(this occours in the following case: if the user accepts an autocompletion  then the text is changed via settext(). thus  in incremental and live filter mode  two searches are performed.) - ~~the searchworker implemented the abstractworker interface. as far as i understood  this enables one to do work asynchronously and then change the gui later. however  the worker is simply run via        worker.getworker().run()        worker.getcallback().update()    in my understanding  this defeats completely the purpose of using the abstractworker. what is the right way to run it?~~ - ~~a general observation about the  searchrule  class. every method of it takes the query as an argument. i would propose to save the query internally in   searchrule  and thus simplify the interface a little bit.~~ - ~~the setting  autocomplete names  is not yet implemented. in my opinion this can be completely removed.~~ - ~~the setting  select matches  is not yet implemented since i do not understand the purpose of this setting. should it control whatever the first match is selected after the search is performed? moreover  i think it was not implemented in the old search pane.~~  things which should be done at some point (i will open a ticket after this pull request was accepted): - all the other inline autocompletions (in fields for example) should also use the new dropdown style autocompleter - search result table is not styled the same as main table  related [sf bug 847](http://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/847/),UI,Network,IO,Throws,User Preferences,Logging,Runtime,Utils,Data Structure

There is an ongoing discussion of features at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/104#issuecomment-155466078. - concurrency bug as data structures are shared (boolean) - documentation update (english) - documentation update (german) - disable/enable open in new window and global search only when a search has been executed previously - Why is  Regex  search enabled by default? I would have expected it to be turned off as default. (I reset my preferences and started a vanilla JabRef . - Remove debug output - ESC should leave the search and focus the currently selected entry - I pressed  CTRL+f  multiple times. The view changed (behavior due to old JabRef behavior  I would like to have that removed).  - Further  I cannot switch back from  Filter  to  Float . Have to restart JabRef. Steps:  Float  is activated. Search for a string where you can see the floated area. Switch to  Filter . OK. Switch back to  Float : Nothing happens. After a restart  float works as usual. - Preview is broken in combination with the new search. When switching from  Float  to  Fitler  and back: The preview panel constantly updates and the empty area above the entry grows and grows. However  this is a separate issue. --> fixed as this was a larger concurrency issue as a lot of code was NOT executed on the Swing EDT... - search is not aware of currently active groups. hence  the displayed search results (found x matches) may be strange to the user when no entries are shown at all. - when the advanced search is active  the search icon on the left is marked red.  - critical focus is lost from the search window sometimes as the entry editor can grab the focus in some cases. fixed by removing the set focus upon changing the entry editor tab.,Data Structure,Utils,Logging,Runtime,UI

501,[wip] prototype for new entrytype interface,this is a prototype for an idea to resolve the issues discussed in #337 and #495.  right now the entry type is converted from a string representation (in the bibtex file) to an entrytype by the parser. the problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode. the idea was to add an intermediate step: string (in bibtex file) -> entryclass (by parser) -> entrytype (by some factory using information from the preferences) - there is an enum  standardentryclass  holding all the standard types regardless of bibtex or biblatex (so article  mvbook  etc  all are there). to support also unknown entry types we have the class  nonstandardentryclass . so for example  parsing  @article{}  results in  class = standardentryclass.article  while  @gibberish{}  yields  class = nonstandardentryclass  with name  gibberish . in this way the type information is stored in a relative convenient form (better then a string).  the idea of an enum implementing an interface was taken from the way java handles standard file locations. see [the oracle blog ](https://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/enums_and_mixins) (or [another blog](http://blog.pengyifan.com/how-to-extend-enum-in-java/)). - the  entryclass  does not know about required and optional fields. these information are provided by the  entrytypefactory . for example   entrytypefactory(prefs).gettypefor(standardentryclass.article).getrequiredfields()  gives the required fields.   please ignore all the  my  prefixes in the class names.,Logging,Utils,Data Structure,IO

572,refactor cleanup code,this pr (again) refactors the cleanup department. the motivation was to extract as much logic as possible from the cleanup action to make it easier to use cleanup operations also at different points (like on save).  biggest changes: - move preferences controlling the cleanup process to own data class  cleanuppreset  and the execution of the cleanup process to  cleanupworker . thus starting a cleanup process is reduced to setting up a proper preset and passing it to the worker. - move code displaying and changing a preset to a separate class. hence it is now easy to show and change a preset at a different place (like in the preferences).  - move preferences code to  jabrefpreferences . well  this is the place where it belongs. - add tests for the  cleanupworker . more detailed tests of the different cleanup processes are still missing.  todo s/breaking changes: these are all related to the fact that there is no nice interface to get/set the file field of an entry (all the code is in the gui class filelisttablemodel). - the counting of unsuccessful renames does not work anymore (i vote for removing this completely) - remove cleanuputil and incorperate the code in the respective cleanup classes. currently this code relies on gui code (filelisttablemodel) and thus cannot easily be moved to logic. - test the file related cleanups.,IO,UI,Throws,Dependency,Data Structure,Logging,Test,Utils,User Preferences,Network

718,improve database writer,the aim of this pr is to improve the database writer  in particular fix #621 and #669.  also add tests to the writer and parser (and do some refactorings to make test writing easier).  changes (to serialization): - fix #621 and #669 by adding new lines after encoding and preamble. the idea is that everything is terminated by a new line and the parsed serialization only safes newlines which separate it from the previous entry.  - comments and preamble are serialized with capitalized first letter  i.e.  @comment  instead of  @comment  and  @preamble  instead of  @preamble . this should follow the convention for entries. - there is no space anymore between  @string  and the bracket and after the bracket  i.e.  @string{name = {string}}  instead of  @string { name = {string} }  - implemented [#756](https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/756): add possibility to reformat all entries on save (under preferences  file)  refactorings: - renamed fileactions to bibdatabasewriter - merged code for export and save in bibdatabasewriter - extracted savesettings class from fileactions to own file and extended it (& renamed to savepreferences). note that this class has some setters (against the recently established convention for preference classes) since there are quite a few cases where the values from the preferences have to be overriden.  - change usage of arrays to list in many places - remove unused boolean parameters checksearch  checkgroup - moved writing of metadata and customentrytypesmanager to bibdatabasewriter - extracted and reused gui code for displaying and editing sort preferences (saveorderconfigdisplay),Data Structure,Network,Logging,Utils,UI,IO

1205,change output level from info to debug to remove clutter in the output,when openning a file and special fields are used  users currently **always** get the message  info net.sf.jabref.importer.opendatabaseaction - synchronized special fields based on keywords  displayed. this is confusing. see for example https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/742#issuecomment-209811934.  currently  jabref uses  info  for errors and warnings  too:  ![grabbed_20160414-125653](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/14525943/6040e82e-0240-11e6-8916-1c1dda2da3d2.png)  the synchronized message is a debug message  which should not be shown in the general case.  to be consistent with the current logging approach  i changed the log level for a message from  info  to  debug . this also reduces clutter in the log and on the console.   the alternative is to rethink all log levels and the preferred default output.,Database,IO,Utils,Data Structure,Logging

1215,improved conversion maps and conversion speed,the html/unicode <-> latex conversion map source was based on regular expressions making it a jungle of backslashes. now  replace is used instead of replaceall so fewer backslashes and (theoretically) a bit faster.  i also added benchmarking for the following conversions: - html to latex (used at import  cleanup and save action) - latex to html (used for preview) - latex to unicode (used for table rendering)   and i got a slight improvement  although i cannot really tell why the two latter are faster now as they are based on cleaned versions... one reason might be that the tests are based on latex symbols with more backslashes in them for the old case...  before: benchmarks.htmltolatexconversion      5533.070 ▒   86.148  ops/s benchmarks.latextohtmlconversion     141500.226 ▒ 8011.038  ops/s benchmarks.latextounicodeconversion  124527.930 ▒ 3984.776  ops/s  after: benchmarks.htmltolatexconversion     6153.450 ▒   114.716  ops/s benchmarks.latextohtmlconversion     168037.040 ▒ 13412.341  ops/s benchmarks.latextounicodeconversion  173674.308 ▒  7455.006  ops/s  here one can see that only searching the string to be converted once is far better than running replace on all possible characters. which is not surprising  but require quite complicated code.  finally  with the simpler strings it was easier to add most (all?) of the curly brackets required to solve #405 .,Data Structure

1471,preserve user comments in bib file,so i am finally having my take at #1026. the current solution was surprisingly easy so far (despite what i had written before). it looks explicitly for our encoding prefix in the file ( encoding:  ) and kills lines that contain it (but only lines preceding an entry  it will not delete something that is inside an entry). other user comments are left untouched and are _always_ written out again  even if the entry is reformatted.  user comments that are above meta data  bibtex strings  or the preamble will still be removed  though. changing that would require large scale changes to these items in our model  since we would also need to store the parsed serialization for them  which we do not do so far.  this should receive significant automated  but also manual  testing  since it modifies a quite critical part and has the potential to destroy bib files. i will add a few more tests for this pr. - -,IO,Test,Data Structure

1552,performance improvements for groups,the bibentry now stores a list of words which are contained in the field. in this way the keywordgroup.ismatch method just has to compare two arrays instead of analyzing strings over and over again. for a big file (> 7000 entries  > 100 groups) the load time decreased by 1 sec from 4.8 seconds to 3.7. half of the time needed for showing the groups tree is spent in calculating the number of hits. moreover  subsequent rerendings of the groups tree (for example after changing an entry) are also quicker.  note that the match algorithm changed slightly. for example  previously looking for  test  in  some$test  resulted in a match  this is no longer the case. however  normal word separators (like whitespace  comma and semicolon are recognized properly)  i.e. searching for  test  in  some test  returns true.  also fixed a npe. - - - ),Data Structure,Utils

2162,specialfields refactoring,rewrite of #1964   this kept bugging me  so i invested some time in it. it integrates the changes from #1964 and turns the different special fields into enum values. the different classes composing special fields are now aligned to our architecture. the enum  specialfield  has to go to  logic  as it involves quite some localization.  there are still some possible improvements based on this pr  in particular: - outsourcing localization from  specialfield  so that this class can be moved into  model  (this is not necessarily needed  though) - rewriting  specialfieldsutil   which is already marked as deprecated.  to maintain a reasonable scope for this pr  these improvements should be done in separate new prs. they should now also be much simpler based on the new structure. - manually tested changed features in running jabref,HTTP,User Preferences,IO,UI,Utils,Data,Concurrency,Throws,Data Structure,Test,Network,Dependency,Logging

2364,be more friendly when using journal alias field,i d like to copy bibtex entries to biblatex databases and vice versa. when using required fields only  this works perfectly. when in biblatex mode  jabref does not display the value of  journal  in the required fields  because jabref demands the field  journaltitle . this is not only confusing for me  but also for other users: #2209.  i know that a clean solution is #521. this  however  won t happen this year.  i also know that a bibtex-to-biblatex converter and biblatex-to-bibtex converter is another solution. this  however  forces users to run these when copying and pasting between databases. this could be solved by running these converters silently when copying and pasting. when jabref is used in parallel to other software (such as notepad++)  this does not help. i cannot force everyone to use jabref. thus  simply supporting  journal  in jabref is the solution for me.   the biblatex manual states:  > journal field (literal) > an alias for journaltitle  provided for bibtex compatibility. see § 2.2.2.  thus  it is not deprecated  but an alias and should imho be considered as full alternative for  journaltitle .  <s>i am aware that this patch makes it hard for users using full biblatex with  journaltitle  instead of  journal . i am assuming that not much users are aware of the different modes of jabref and that they switch back and forth for the same file or for the bibentries.</s>  we now show both  journaltitle  and  journal  if these fields exists in as required fields.  this whole discussion somehow refs https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/160   * minor improvement: enhanced integrity checks testing for biblatex-only fields to be aware of more fields (e.g.   location ).  * all fetchers return now bibtex.

However  IllegalArgumentException is a runtime exception and so it was easy to miss that one should catch this exception properly. Fixed by introducing the checked exception InvalidFieldValueException.  In the longer term  we should probably replace this check completely by the integrity checker.

2754,entry editor goes javafx,<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ... -->  so now that we have released the beta version  we can go back to the alpha state with this pr 😄. i actually just wanted to have a look at the autocompletion and use some built-in javafx functionality for it. however  just changing the jtextarea s to their javafx equivalent wasn t possible since the editor components (additional buttons next to the text area) required jtextareas. thus  eating the foul egg (= easter version of  in den sauren apfel beißen )  i started to migrate the whole entry editor to javafx. so far only the doi component is re-implemented.  points to notice: - using javafx bindings  there is no longer the need to manually update the entry after a changed happened. this should fix these nasty bugs that sometimes changes in the editor got lost when performing a different action. moreover  the main table is instantly updated with the changes in the editor. - i opted for a slightly different architecture. previously  there were the text field and additional components. now these are combined into one fieldeditor. - as for the groups interface  i will continue slowly to reimplement the other field editors. - the style is not that different from the swing version. for the buttons  i only used images: ![snipimage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5037600/25102492/f8b61756-23b8-11e7-8024-e9ff48b132c5.jpg)  ------   - - - ) - - if you changed the localization: did you run  gradle localizationupdate ?,Utils,Test,UI,Network,HTTP,Concurrency,Data Structure,IO,Security,Data,XML,Logging

I removed this as I think nobody really knew about it in the first place and moreover it also takes 2 clicks to select the current date with the calendar popup.  There are still some layout problems (small width  additional empty line below it) that are probably a result of the mixed Swing and JavaFX stuff.

2995,less backups,addresses #2993  the frequent events are due to the bidirectional binding which transfers every change directly into the bibentry. if we want fewer events  the only solution will probably be to break the binding  which would be very disappointing for the javafx implementation. in my point of view the problem is not on the side of event creation. after all  every change should trigger an event and javafx triggers many changes. imho  this should be fixed in how we react to events.  i also noticed the exception  but do not get a dialog. this seems to happen because of the save operation invoked by the backup.  a solution might be to do less backups  by:  1. doing backups only every x events and not for every event  2. ignoring fieldchangeevents in the backup  3. adding the size of the field change in the fieldchangeevent class  so that you can ignore it if only 1 character changed.  this pr combines options 1. and 3.  i.e.: the backup manager ignores events that are very minor and only does a backup if enough of them have happened (currently set to five).  what do you think?   - - - ) - - if you changed the localization: did you run  gradle localizationupdate ?,Utils,Logging,IO,Data Structure,Network,Concurrency

3095,fix for issue 3052,<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ... --> This is an atempt to fix the problem with entry editor focus as described in #3052. In detail  when  EntryEditor  opens up  it is not focused automatically. The desired behavior is to focus the first  Textfield  on any of the  EntryEditor  s tabs.  The way the fix is implemented: when  EntryEditor  is opened  the  JFXPanel  in which is the  TabPane  of the  EntryEditor  is getting the focus  The focus is given implicitly to a focusTraversable node contained in the  JFXPanel . The selection of the node seems to be  random  (even though consistent for a given tree of nodes). As far as I ve tested it consistently focuses the first  Textfield  on any tab  which is the desired behavior. I make this pull requested as suggested in #3052 discussion by @Siedlerchr .  I should mention that I ran  gradle check  which results in  6 tests failed  in my setup but this was also the result when I ran the test before making any change.  - - - ) - - if you changed the localization: did you run  gradle localizationupdate ?,IO,Data Structure,Memory,Test,Network,Text Utility,CommandLine,Utils,User Preferences,Throws,UI,Logging,Dependency

EDIT: Also fixes a second (unreported) issue: Now the base panel is marked as dirty when you type something in the source tab.  EDIT 2: Fixes also  #3063  Now the Other fields tab is rebuilt whenever an other field is newly added or removed at the BibEntry.

3116,move event processing from source tab into entry editor,Solves the most critical part of #3113  The source tab did not properly unregister itself from the event bus. For some reason  I did not manage to get this working when the source tab takes care of deregistration. Therefore  I moved all event handling out of the source tab and into the entry editor.  Using jvisualvm  I can see that garbage collection works with this PR. Cycling through the main table with the entry editor open increases used RAM. When you force garbage collection  the used heap goes down to close to zero again  instead of staying at a higher plateau. See attached screenshot  ![heap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515701/29381572-f60537f6-82c9-11e7-9ad9-20e6208ca648.png)  So this fixes the memory leak.

The reason for this is that Java tries to fit them in the available display space. Examples: #3130 #3117 #2941  This PR sets a minimum size for all TextAreas in the EntryEditor. The value of 70px is rather arbitrary and I ll be happy to get some thoughts if this is good or if more or less is desirable. With this minimum size all TextAreas are nicer to read  even in the cramped up General tab. The only  problem  is that you now need to scroll in the General tab most of the time.

3273,set wm_class to org-jabref-jabrefmain,WM_CLASS is used by certain Un*x window managers  such as GNOME  to map windows to the corresponding application. Currently WM_CLASS is set to java-lang-Thread which is very generic and not unique to JabRef. Instead  use reflection to set it to org-jabref-JabRefMain which resembles the main class name.

I m not aware of a more convenient way to manually set WM_CLASS.  I tested the change on a Linux system running GNOME 3 and also on macOS to rule out any cross-platform issues. Also I chose the WM_CLASS name that matches the StartupWMClass in [buildres/snapcraft/jabref.desktop](../blob/master/buildres/snapcraft/jabref.desktop)  so no changes are necessary in there.  <!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ... -->  - - - ) - - if you changed the localization: did you run  gradle localizationupdate ?,UI

3305,improvement for java fx font rendering on linux,The font-rendering of Java FX on Linux seems to be generally not as good as on other systems. I found the repo [Java FX hates Linux](https://github.com/woky/javafx-hates-linux) helpful which made a comparison for different settings for the *prism rendering engine*.  That being said  I found simply setting      java System.setProperty( prism.text    t2k )  System.setProperty( prism.lcdtext    true )      provides the best font rendering without having to make changes in css that might affect other systems.  This pull-request adds a checkbox under Settings -> Appearance -> Look and Feel to turn this on after a restart. I incorporated it into the preference framework. On Linux  it is turned on in the default settings.   ![settings](http://i.imgur.com/yHvh8AN.png)  When turning it is turned on  the fonts are less blurry and the color bleaching is highly reduced (although we don t use gray scale font smoothing!).

3327,fix location bundle with fast access,this pr addresses the issue i mentioned under [localization memory](https://github.com/jabref/jabref/pull/3187#issuecomment-337464813). to provide a reasonable implementation and not only a bugfix i had to change the layout. these things bothered me the most:  -  localizationbundle  and  localization  were calling each other. we needed  localization  to create the keys in the bundle and on the other hand  the  localizationbundle  was only used in the  localization  class -  localization  seemed like a quick fix to provide messages as bundle to java fx - on each call to any function in these classes  the unescaping of messages was done again. this  in particular  was the reason why showed up as hot spot in the profiler  to unify the implementation  i based the complete  localization  framework on two instances (menus and messages) of  localizationbundle  and made this an internal class as it should not be used without it. the bundles are (re)created when  setlanguage  is called and contain the unescaped keys and messages for the specified language as a fast hash table.  this enables two things: (1) we can pass the  localizationbundle  instance directly to java fx with  getmessages  and since we only pass the reference to the hash table  it will be instantaneous. (2) every call to  lang  or  menutitle  is a simple lookup in the hash table and a replacement of possible parameters in the string.  the public api for  localization   meaning  lang    menutitle    getmessages  and  setlanguage  did not change and works as expected. during profiling/debugging i noticed  however  that there is a flaw in the jabref startup. the language is set after the initialization of the preferences. at least one preference setting uses a localized string in a static field. since when uninitialized  the  localization  reverts back to  en   these strings will never be in the user language (see [this issue](https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/3326)). furthermore  due to this access  the  localization  framework will always be initialized several times. once in the init of the preferences and once further down in  main .  this can only be fixed by pushing  setlanguage  to the initialization of the preferences which i did. one additional minor thing was that one message key was used escaped and had to be unescaped. other than that  this implementation worked out of the box and passed all existing localization tests.  i commented my code heavily and would be glad if someone would review it. don t forget that i m looking only about 5 days on the code base and it is very likely i have overlooked something.,Utils,Data Structure,Logging,Throws

3340,used late initialization for context menus,i believe i could bring down the performance impact of the context menus to a bare minimum. i reported this in https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/3335 and @tobiasdiez provided me with the hint how this could work. against his suggestion to not overshoot  i decided to prove my point that even those small context menus have a significant impact because things will sum up in the end and those menus are newly instantiated for every visible field in the editor.  the starting point was the current master-branch and profiling it by going through only 50 bib-entries. this means that the context menus are instantiated for the visible text fields. this has an impact on performance and memory and  unfortunately  it is not only a tiny fraction.   ## memory  notable are the columns  objects   which are all objects that are created by this method and underlying sub calls and the overall  size .  ![mem1](http://i.imgur.com/pjbjslf.png)  with almost 40% of the overall memory size  it s definitely something to look into.  ## performance  the performance is with 8% not so large but still noticeable.   ![perf1](http://i.imgur.com/stsggnj.png)  ## fixing it  by using the  supplier  interface  we can move the instantiation to the point where the user actually right-clicks into the field. i debugged this  and it seems to work nice. the outcome was as expected. since no one actually triggers the context menu by just browsing through the list  it vanished altogether. here is the used memory with this pr created by exactly scrolling through the 50 entries. first the memory footprint  ![mem2](http://i.imgur.com/drrkaxs.png)  and here the performance impact  ![perf2](http://i.imgur.com/hgjnhll.png)  in conclusion  this means as long as the user doesn t need a context menu  we have no memory or performance impact at all.  ## note  i updated the  checkstyle  version in the gradle built. i like to write comments  and now it doesn t prevent me any longer from using  {@link ...}  in doc-comments to classes that are otherwise not used.  - - - ) - - if you changed the localization: did you run  gradle localizationupdate ?,UI,Dependency,Utils

3418,checking java version on startup,this is not quite ready for review  but i appreciate some feedback. since  localizationupdate  seems broken  the messages are currently not added and i m waiting for the fix.the logic behind the java check is as follows:  1. in  gradle.build  we can define the  minrequiredjavaversion  which is added as a value to  build.properties  as this was the most fitting place and it makes the version check quite flexible. i did not use an upper bound for the version but a boolean  allowjava9  indicator. the reasoning behind it is that a developer who is actually working on the java 9 support just has to change this value to make jabref start. 2. i put the version check as a method into  buildinfo . other possible places would be  globals  or when we give the build-info as a parameter then  javaversioncheck  itself. suggestions? 3. the version check is called pretty early in  main  (as soon as localization is set up). i didn t bother to put the single error dialog into a separate class. therefore  the logic of checking  showing the message and probably exiting is done directly there. is this acceptable?  the version check itself has the only requirement to successfully access  system.getproperty( java.version ) . i implemented a very *optimistic* check that doesn t fail if we cannot determine or compare the versions. only if we are sure that the used version is not sufficient  it will fail.  this will solve https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/3310,Test,IO,Utils,CommandLine,Network,Logging,UI,Data Structure

The code is more than 12 years old and almost as bad as the bibtex parser used to be.  This PR is based on two decisions:  - I do not want to change the old layouting code. If I do  I am almost guaranteed to break it in many ways. - I do not know if the removal of empty lines in exported text is really desirable in all cases. Maybe users wrote their custom formatters to explicitly include empty lines? I cannot tell.  We now have one case (RIS export) where empty lines are not desired. So  I implemented a solution that only changes the behavior of the RIS export  but leaves all others untouched. Nonetheless  it is very easy (single constructor parameter) to let other formats use empty line elimination as well.   The empty line elimination is done using a hardly understandable  but fully functional regex.   ----  - - - ) -,Network,Data Structure,Utils,IO,Logging

3942,[wip] add external application selection to preferences,wip - add external application selection to preferences  this pull request is in regards to #674.  this initial commit adds a button to the settings panel for each external application which allows the user to select an application to make default. there is currently a problem with this build where the application will not update the pushtoapplicationbutton. i believe the issue has something to do with the interaction between javafx and swing components. also i plan on adding keybinding options as well in the future  it s just taking me a bit of time to familiarize myself with the program between life events. let me know what you think so far and on the direction i am taking.,Data Structure,Logging,UI,Network,Utils,IO

If it s on Windows  the  \r\n  will be replaced with a whitespace  and it is OK. However if we encounter  .\r\n   the  .\r  will be reserved and the  \n  will be replaced by a whitespace. In this way  the  .\r  will not be shown as new line int the field  and we don t need this whitespace. So instead we should change  .\r\n  to  \r\n  directly.

The changes are as follows: - Introduce extended enum  Field  for fields (e.g  StandardField.AUTHOR  instead of the string  author ) and use this everywhere. Besides the name of the field  some basic and universal properties are stored (e.g. whether it is a numeric field) - Introduce the class  BibField  which enriches the  Field  by properties that depend on the entry (type) where this field is used. Right now this is only how important the field is (which should in the long term replace the required/optional dichometry.   - Introduce extended enum  EntryType  for entry types (e.g.  StandardEntryType.ARTICLE  instead of the string  article ) and use this everywhere.  - Introduce the class  BibEntryType  that enriches an  EntryType  by properties that the user can configure (e.g. required fields).  I tried to not change any behavior  except the following things that I noticed while testing: - All fields are now properly sorted alphabetically (in the subgroups of required/optional fields) when the entry is written to the bib file. - Some importers used the field  pubstatus  instead of the standard BibTeX field  pubstate .    ----  - - -- )  ,IO,XML,Network,Text Utility,Test,Data Structure

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. -->  ### What this PR adds? This PR is related to [koppor#343](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/343).  I added a field formatter called **Shorten DOI** formatter which shortens DOI using http://shortdoi.org service. You run the formatter from _Cleanup entries dialog_ by adding it to _Run field formatter_ list.  It looks to work fine. It enables one way conversion from DOI to short DOI.  ### Implementation details: I assumed that short DOI is still a legal DOI. That s why I adjusted the DOI class to work with short DOIs.  ### Feedback wanted I I d like to ask for your feedback about the code at this stage.  ### Next step - Add a more accessible UI - a toggle button next to the DOI field _shortened/long version_ (This was suggested by @koppor)  This will require adding opposite conversion (from short DOI to DOI). As http://shortdoi.org servcie doesn t offer such a feature I see two approaches:  1. Store the original DOI during the conversion for further back conversion. **Drawback:** You may not convert from short DOI to DOI if you haven t done the opposite conversion for at least one time. 2. Try to obtain DOI from short DOI using https://doi.org service as it is possible by catching the HTTP redirection  I find the 1st approach fine. The 2th approach is not really good as we are not using any public API and this can stop working in the future.  What do you think folks? :)  ### Important If you would like to checkout this branch and test locally please use [shortdoi-workaround](https://github.com/dawidowoc/jabref/tree/shortdoi-workaround) branch which uses workaround by @r0light for issue [#5245](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5245).

5315,conversion of preferences/exportsorting  import  maintable and entryeditor to mvvm,follow-up to #5033   this pr ha grown pretty huge too  although there is nothing really complicated in it. the four very simple tabs are converted and i included some suggestions about templates/generics and icons @tobiasdiez made in [#5185 comment](https://github.com/jabref/jabref/pull/5185#discussion_r322013878) and in [#5265](https://github.com/jabref/jabref/pull/5265#discussion_r320335661).  the saveorderconfigdisplay had to be refactored  as there were some bugs: it did not want to set the values after resetting the preferences and it could not load the fields-class (crazy java9-module-stuff)  so i also had to change some exports in the modules-info. there i also included some changes out of the gitter-discussion.  i already got some ideas how to resort all the preferences and options in the options-menu  one could change the listview on the sidepane to a treeview and start thinning each tab into small preferencetabs. the help buttons could also be somehow adjusted for each tab at the same position. (maybe somewhere to the right of the title)  i guess there are some things to be discussed or corected in this pr  so im looking forward for your comments.  ![exportsorting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925794-1c67c480-d7f6-11e9-9015-5e296a8db0da.png) ![entryeditor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925795-1c67c480-d7f6-11e9-8778-9ec7df1bc648.png) ![import](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925796-1c67c480-d7f6-11e9-8f0f-a4c714c6603e.png) ![entrytable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925797-1f62b500-d7f6-11e9-8367-1e3227882188.png)  ----  - - -- )  ,UI,Dependency,Utils

5439,jabrefexecutorservice improvement,i made a very minor update on the current jabrefexecutorservice to support the very modern way of handling asynchronous tasks by using completablefuture objects. using completablefuture instad of the usual future object allows chaining of several asynchronous tasks very easily. this is a much more flexible way of dealing with asynchronous operations. i highly recomment using those methods i added instead of the old ones.  for those that are unfamiliar with the completablefuture pattern  they might want to have a look at my personal [project](https://github.com/brainsucker92/picalculator/blob/master/src/main/java/calculator/impl/chudnovskycalculator.java) where i used this to split and chain some very expensive calculations which gave me a very simple but huge increase in throughput.  - - -- )  ,XML,Network,Database,Logging,Dependency,Data Structure,IO,Utils,Throws,Concurrency,Data,UI

JabRef should store instead in the columnPreferences not the fields  but the columns e.g.  groups  or  special:rank  or  field:author . The result would be  that the user is able to have a clickable uri-column  linked_id  in one column  and in another  field:url  the uri printed out. Also they should finally be reorderable.

5665,improve change scanner,if a file is changed externally  jabref is doing a 3-way merge between the last saved value vs current value in jabref vs new value in file. the way this is done is by first comparing the last saved file with the current (changed) file  and then trying to find additional/other changes in the currently open database. this is really complex and i believe there is some subtle bug in the logic leading to #5257.  with this pr  the change scanner is changed to a to simple 2-way merge between the current value in jabref vs new value in file. this is way simpler and i hope this pr fixes #5257. in a few edge cases  the 2-way merge has a small disadvantage. for example  consider the following steps: - user a opens file - user a changes field  author  to  user a  and adds field  title  with value  new  - user b opens file - user b changes field  author  to  user b  - user b saves file  at this point  user a gets a message that the file changed with the following changes: - field  author  changed from  user a  to  user b  - field  title  was removed  the 3-way merge could detect that  title  was newly added  and thus could automatically reapply this change.  this is no longer possible with the simple 2-way merge.  <!--  describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...  link issues by using the following pattern: #333. if you fixed a koppor issue  link it with following pattern: [koppor#47](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/47). the title of the pr must not reference an issue  because github does not support autolinking there. -->   <!--  - all items with   are still a todo. - all items checked with   are done. - remove items not applicable -->  - (if applicable) - (if applicable) -(always required) - ) - [checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): is the information available and up to date? if not: issue created at <https://github.com/jabref/user-documentation/issues>.,IO,Data Structure,Utils

5669,[wip] fix change on disk detection,this will solve the whole change-on-disk-dection things similar as conflicts are solved for a shared-database. this pr builds on https://github.com/jabref/jabref/pull/5640 and is an alternative to https://github.com/jabref/jabref/pull/5665.  ## implementation motivation  in 2016  i designed the database synchronization feature (https://docs.jabref.org/collaborative-work/sqldatabase)  which i briefly described at https://github.com/jabref/jabref/pull/2866#issuecomment-388264343:  - multiple users should be supported  seamlessly  - if user a and b work on the bibfile  a modification by user a on a bibtex entry b1 should not trigger any  changes  dialog if user b did not do any changes. - a  merge entries  dialog should popup if users a and b modified the same entry.  how this works can be tried out using the [shared sql database feature](http://help.jabref.org/en/sqldatabase) of jabref  where @obraliar and me worked hard to  have a very nice user experience.  technically  this is not that easy to achieve. however  users will be happy  if it  just works .  at each instance of jabref:  - local state l is known - remote state r is known - in case an update is made remotely  the diff can be applied to r.   so r  is known. based on r and r   the entries e where a change was made  are known.   based on e  changes can be applied to l.   if in l the entry was not modified: just apply the update.   if in l the entry was modified: start the merge entries dialog.  ## implementation idea  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1366654/69493789-68e51580-0eb3-11ea-9da8-319a9ebfb246.png)  ## current implementation state  todo:  - add tests (multi-threading: update file in parallel  ... !) - saved flag local in the update monitor - work on work on bibdatabasediff only - trigger the merge entries popup  optional: - instead of the merge entries dialog  the changes should be displayed - add a button to the change display panel to open the merge entries dialog  because the merge entries dialog has a visual diff instead of a text-only description.  done:  - after a synchronization is triggered: the referencefile is updated with the current database - synchronize change detection and file writing: should not happen in parallel - use !thread.currentthread().isinterrupted() instead of true in endless loop in thread  <!--  - all items with   are still a todo. - all items checked with   are done. - remove items not applicable -->  - (if applicable) - (if applicable) -(always required) - ) - [checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): is the information available and up to date? if not: issue created at <https://github.com/jabref/user-documentation/issues>.,IO,Data Structure,Utils,Logging,Network,UI
