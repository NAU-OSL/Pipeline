I like the new add/remove/move panel  but the scrolling is not working  which is a big problem. Because I have lots of groups which cannot even fit into the full screen height after expansion. 3. no way to expand or collapse all nodes  I tried the dev version  all problems still exist. Here is my fixation.  Cheers   W.L.
11;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;BugFix for bug  #880 PubMed Import broken;Found bug: PubMed/Medline PLAIN format recognized as RIS format. Provided solution:     - Modified RIS ImportFilter. Now RIS format is identified by looking for the  TY  tag (it is a mandatory tag in RIS format and it is not conflictual with other filters)     - Added new ImportFilter  MedlinePlain . This import filter parses Medline files in plain format (not XML). The import filter has been produced referring to the official Medline documentation (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html)     - Updated the net.sf.jabref.core plugin.xml file in order to include the newly added MedlinePlain import filter

The latter might be a bit simple-minded --  should the field to consider depend on whether Biblatex mode is actually turned on?
18;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;Fix edits getting lost in Biblatex mode;This fixes a bug where edits made in a field on a CompressedEntryEditorTab wouldn t get stored when the field editor lost focus. The bug was caused by EntryEditorTabFocusListener accessing the unused inherited parent field of CompressedEntryEditorTab instances instead of the latter class s own (private) parent field. Instead of doing just a quick fix  I decided to eliminate the excessive code and data duplication in the two classes altogether and consolidate them into one class (with an additional flag to the constructor)  since I don t think an extra class is warranted here (and easily and sensibly implementable by derivation).

These buttons allow panes to be swapped with the pane above or below them  respectively.  Whenever the panes are reordered  the current position of each visible pane is recorded in the application preferences  so the user s custom ordering can be preserved when JabRef is next run.

I haven t included a CHANGELOG entry  since this commit effectively just corrects a minor oversight on my behalf when adding this menu entry in [a previous pull request](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/48)  but I m happy to add one if deemed necessary.
55;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;Mac bundle and integration for Java 7;These changes creates a new compilation target for JabRef  in order to make a Mac application bundle which can work with the newer Oracle JVM for Mac (versions 7 and 8)  and change the code of the wrapper to integrate the Apple events with the non-deprecated API in com.apple.eawt.  Main changes are: - Create a new target based on Oracle s appbundler to create a bundle compatible with newer JVMs. (not compatible with Apple s JVM). - Move the older target to Jabref-legacy.app. - Remove the old deprecated wrapper OSXAdapter  which does not work with Oracle s JVM. - Create new wrapper based on com.apple.eawt (compatible with both JVMs). - Improve the quit behaviour. - Add support for the Fullscreen feature.  The code changes are compatible with both Oracle s JVMs and Apple legacy one  but the legacy bundle is currently broken as the code requires Java 1.7+. Tested with Apple s JVM (1.6.0_65) and Oracle s JVM (1.8.0_45).

In particular: - Updates license headers with current date - Syntax optimizations: Java 1.7 use of generics (diamond operator) - Format code according to Java conventions (C-style curly brackets  I am looking at you) - Improves exception handling with logging - Replace usages of Exception with more precise Exceptions - Improves variable names - Removes commented-out code  unused private methods (unused public methods/constructors are not eliminated) - Use try-with-resources if possible - Delete stale comments - Replace StringBuffer with StringBuilder - Remove history information from JavaDoc  (I am aware that I could push this directly  since I am now a contributor. As this started out as a pull request  I want to finish it as such. Future cotributions will be made directly to jabref/master)

To preserve visibility constraints  this requires the relocation of many more classes that have package-local dependencies on the above two classes.   Variables / methods in  JabRefFrame  with reduced visibility that are accessed from  JabRef  were made  public   since the latter class clearly does not belong to the gui package.

I m not aware of any bugs  but I m sure there are some.  (By the way  what is now the correct way to include external libraries?

What is changed: - no support for custom icon themes anymore - a smaller GUIGlobals class - more explicit referencing of icons - less setup logic that is required to be called explicitly - when no icon is available  the default one (red.png at the moment) will be used. This allows to detect icon errors -> see below - less code  Uncovered issues through this change: - the action openFolder is used in the icon bar  but as it had no icon  it was never displayed to the user. this is now marked explicitly in red  allowing us developers to fix this.

Anyone who wants this feature to stay?  Is there any other validation facility in place where we could add the checks instead?

(Except the clean commit history )  The changes include: - Search bar is now at the top - Autocompletion suggestions are shown in a popup - Search options are available via a drop-down list  this implements Feature Request #853 -  Clear search  button also clears search field  this implements Feature Request #601 - In incremental search mode: next result is selected by pressing enter (instead of Control + F as previously) - Incremental search now uses the same search engine as the other search modes - Added a new search mode (Live filter) which filters the table as soon as the search text is changed  I have a few questions: - ~~There are quite a few changes from formatting the code in Eclipse. Is it ok if I include them?~~ - I have a problem with listening to changes in the textfield and programatically setting the text with setText(). The latter command triggers first an event for the deletion of the text and then another one for inserting the new one. Is there a way to be informed just once about such a change? (This occours in the following case: if the user accepts an autocompletion  then the text is changed via setText(). Thus  in incremental and live filter mode  two searches are performed.) - ~~The SearchWorker implemented the AbstractWorker interface. As far as I understood  this enables one to do work asynchronously and then change the GUI later. However  the worker is simply run via        worker.getWorker().run()        worker.getCallBack().update()    In my understanding  this defeats completely the purpose of using the AbstractWorker. What is the right way to run it?~~ - ~~A general observation about the  SearchRule  class. Every method of it takes the query as an argument. I would propose to save the query internally in   SearchRule  and thus simplify the interface a little bit.~~ - ~~The setting  Autocomplete names  is not yet implemented. In my opinion this can be completely removed.~~ - ~~The setting  Select matches  is not yet implemented since I do not understand the purpose of this setting. Should it control whatever the first match is selected after the search is performed? Moreover  I think it was not implemented in the old search pane.~~  Things which should be done at some point (I will open a ticket after this pull request was accepted): - All the other inline autocompletions (in fields for example) should also use the new dropdown style autocompleter - Search result table is not styled the same as main table  related [SF Bug 847](http://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/847/)

It replaces  String[]  in the return types of  BibtexEntryType  with  List<String> . This allows to return immutable lists instead of mutable arrays and improves the stability of the program. Additionally  the rewrite allowed to replace a lot of duplicate object creation with instance variables.  With respect to #122  the immutability of the new lists removes the necessity to create defensive copies and therefore avoids a lot of cloning.

Steps:  Float  is activated. Search for a string where you can see the floated area. Switch to  Filter . OK. Switch back to  Float : Nothing happens. After a restart  float works as usual. - [x] Preview is broken in combination with the new search. When switching from  Float  to  Fitler  and back: The preview panel constantly updates and the empty area above the entry grows and grows. However  this is a separate issue. --> fixed as this was a larger concurrency issue as a lot of code was NOT executed on the Swing EDT... - [ ] Search is not aware of currently active groups. Hence  the displayed search results (found x matches) may be strange to the user when no entries are shown at all. - [x] When the advanced search is active  the search icon on the left is marked red.  - [x] CRITICAL Focus is lost from the search window sometimes as the entry editor can grab the focus in some cases. Fixed by removing the set focus upon changing the entry editor tab.

A better option would be to explicitly lock and unlock the tables  but that require much more work.

I appreciate your feedback about the following points. - [x] Please have a look at the  TODO  comments. These concern string concatenation and  @String  fields. For example in  parseRecognizesDateFieldWithConcatenation  the field  date = {1-4~} # nov  is parsed as  1-4~#nov# . I wouldn t have expect the last sharp symbol. - [x] Tests about JabRef s metadata (groups etc.) are still missing. Mostly  because I don t know the specifications :). Maybe in a new PR. - [x] Related to the previous point  the  GUIGlobals.META_FLAG  flags should be moved to another place (they are not GUI  but parser/writer logic). What would be an appropriate new home for them? - [x] There are 4 tests at the end of the file starting with  test . These tests fail (without the  @Ignore  tag) but I m not sure what they test and what would be the expected behavior in these cases. - [x] There are quite a few ignored tests. These are related to open bugs in SF or are new bugs which I found while writing the tests (nothing big). I will open a new issue for the new bugs after this PR is merged.  For the record: While going through the code  I also changed the following things: - Remove  BibtexParser.isRecognizedFormat  since the code has quite a few shortcomings (whitespace before @ or closing brackets on new lines were a problem) and the execution was quite slow for big files - Fixed a bug where loading a file with corrupted bibtex entries showed an exception  cf.  parseIgnoresAndWarnsAboutCorruptedEntry()  - Made  EntryType  an abstract class which implements the  Comparable  interface and overwrites  equals(Object other) . Thus new expressions like  entry.getType() == BibtexEntryTypes.ARTICLE  return the expected result.

However  there is also gradle task/python script for this. - [x] Unit test that checks that every english translation is equal to the key.  - POSTPONE  <br>  is similar to  \n   but for this we do not have checks yet as well. - POSTPONE Rename  Localization.lang  to  Localization.message  - [x] The KeyBindings use  Localization.lang  directly. - [x] Refactored code of KeyBinding - [x] update documentation - [x] if any resource bundle is not available or if the given locale is not known or if the resource bundles have not bin initialized  always use  en  language.   This is good for a review. The remaining points I would like to ignore as this is really annoying work  and this should be good enough with this PR already.   New process: 1. Add new Localization.lang( KEY ) to Java file. 2. Tests fail. In the test output a snippet is generated which must be added to the english translation file. There is also a snippet generated for the non-english files  but this is irrelevant. 3. Add snippet to english translation file 4. With  gradlew -b localization.gradle compareAndUpdateTranslationsWithEnglishTranslation  the  KEY  is added to the other translation files as well.  5. Tests are green again.

Also  as the approximate string matching is based on edit distance (the number of edits required to turn one string into the other)  it might be that one may operate the complete comparison on the full string rather than the word by word style as currently is used.  I think this is good to go (in the sense that it probably performs better than the previous)  but please check it with a few different databases to make sure that the false positives or missing hits are to frequent.

501;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;[WIP] Prototype for new EntryType interface;This is a prototype for an idea to resolve the issues discussed in #337 and #495.  Right now the entry type is converted from a string representation (in the bibtex file) to an EntryType by the parser. The problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode. The idea was to add an intermediate step: String (in Bibtex file) -> EntryClass (by parser) -> EntryType (by some factory using information from the preferences) - There is an enum  StandardEntryClass  holding all the standard types regardless of bibtex or biblatex (so article  mvbook  etc  all are there). To support also unknown entry types we have the class  NonStandardEntryClass . So for example  parsing  @article{}  results in  class = StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE  while  @gibberish{}  yields  class = NonStandardEntryClass  with name  gibberish . In this way the type information is stored in a relative convenient form (better then a string).  The idea of an enum implementing an interface was taken from the way java handles standard file locations. See [the oracle blog ](https://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/enums_and_mixins) (or [another blog](http://blog.pengyifan.com/how-to-extend-enum-in-java/)). - The  EntryClass  does not know about required and optional fields. These information are provided by the  EntryTypeFactory . For example   entryTypeFactory(prefs).getTypeFor(StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE).getRequiredFields()  gives the required fields.   Please ignore all the  my  prefixes in the class names.

If not  then you check wether there is an element with sources. When you check wether there is an element which contains  Sources   you have both in one. Also if there stands something before or after  Sources   then you go in the if part despite of what stands before or after  Sources .   So we deleted the commented part.

572;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;1;0;1;1;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;Refactor cleanup code;This PR (again) refactors the cleanup department. The motivation was to extract as much logic as possible from the cleanup action to make it easier to use cleanup operations also at different points (like on save).  Biggest changes: - Move preferences controlling the cleanup process to own data class  CleanupPreset  and the execution of the cleanup process to  CleanupWorker . Thus starting a cleanup process is reduced to setting up a proper preset and passing it to the worker. - Move code displaying and changing a preset to a separate class. Hence it is now easy to show and change a preset at a different place (like in the preferences).  - Move preferences code to  JabRefPreferences . Well  this is the place where it belongs. - Add tests for the  CleanupWorker . More detailed tests of the different cleanup processes are still missing.  Todo s/Breaking changes: These are all related to the fact that there is no nice interface to get/set the file field of an entry (all the code is in the gui class FileListTableModel). - The counting of unsuccessful renames does not work anymore (I vote for removing this completely) - Remove CleanupUtil and incorperate the code in the respective cleanup classes. Currently this code relies on gui code (FileListTableModel) and thus cannot easily be moved to logic. - Test the file related cleanups.

Right now the entry type is converted from a string representation (in the bibtex file) to an EntryType by the parser.

The idea was to just store the string in the BibEntry and only get the corresponding EntryType whenever it is really necessary.

All formatters in  net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter  are available.   To support file sharing  the save actions are configured in the meta data of a file as a comment  in the following syntax:      @comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:title LowerCaseChanger }      This above save action applies the LowerCaseChanger for the content of every title field on save.

Also add tests to the writer and parser (and do some refactorings to make test writing easier).  Changes (to serialization): - Fix #621 and #669 by adding new lines after encoding and preamble. The idea is that everything is terminated by a new line and the parsed serialization only safes newlines which separate it from the previous entry.  - Comments and preamble are serialized with capitalized first letter  i.e.  @Comment  instead of  @comment  and  @Preamble  instead of  @PREAMBLE . This should follow the convention for entries. - There is no space anymore between  @String  and the bracket and after the bracket  i.e.  @String{name = {string}}  instead of  @String { name = {string} }  - Implemented [#756](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/756): Add possibility to reformat all entries on save (under Preferences  File)  Refactorings: - Renamed FileActions to BibDatabaseWriter - Merged code for export and save in BibDatabaseWriter - Extracted SaveSettings class from FileActions to own file and extended it (& renamed to SavePreferences). Note that this class has some setters (against the recently established convention for preference classes) since there are quite a few cases where the values from the preferences have to be overriden.  - Change usage of arrays to list in many places - Remove unused boolean parameters checkSearch  checkGroup - Moved writing of metadata and CustomEntryTypesManager to BibDatabaseWriter - Extracted and reused gui code for displaying and editing sort preferences (SaveOrderConfigDisplay)

Another old major issue in OpenOffice was also solved  which relates to crossrefs and strings. Not sure if it was ever triggered  but there was one fundamentally wrong access to a Map.

To accomplish this  the following changes were made: - All the UI related code from the GroupTreeNode class is moved to a new class GroupTreeNodeViewModel  which functions as an adapter from GroupTreeNode to Swing s TreeNode class. - Add classes EntriesGroupChange and MoveGroupChange which store the changes made to the group. The corresponing UI classes UndoableChangeAssignment and UndoableMoveGroup now work as converter to Swing s AbstractUndoableEdit. - Add TreeNode class which is more a less a (typed) copy of Swing s DefaultMutableTreeNode and which contains all the logic for traversing the group tree. - Implement observer interface for changes in the group tree - Some smaller refactorings like moving method from class A to B. - Add tests for the logic classes GroupTreeNode and TreeNode  Since this PR makes quite some changes and there are no tests in place  I wouldn t merge this PR if a new version should be released the next day :smiley: . All the usual functions should work though.  For some reason github shows some of the moved files as removed + added. Locally  gitk shows a correct diff.

Partly implements [kooper #60](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/60).

One question: to write the tests in a nice way I had to overwrite a few equals methods. In particular for the LowerCaseChanger. Should I also override equals for all other formatters?

When an undo with multiple entries is undone  each entry is undone one at a time. The Problem herein lies  that when the first entry is undone  the insertion in the database triggers the creation and insertion of an NamedCompund into the UndoManager which kills the main Undo (the one with the multiple entries)  which result in just one entry being undone.  With this Workaround each entry has its own NamedCompund which solves the Problem but the user has to call the UndoAction several times (Ctrl-Z for each entry). - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described? - [x] Changes in pull request outlined?

This would occur when the second user save happened while the first user save was locking the database file or saving to the tmp file but prior to the copy of the tmp file to the database file. In this case the second user save would not yet see a modified timestamp or size change in the database file and thus start the save process. The save process would wait for the file lock to be removed then overwrite the database causing the changes from the previous save to be lost. This was especially noticeable when the database file resided on a network drive with frequent network latency issues.

Regarding the original quest: - Most uses are for checking null or empty Strings or similarly return an empty String if the input String is null  it may not be worth importing the library just for these two and better to create these two trivial methods in StringUtil (and use them to a larger extent) - There is also  CharMatcher.WHITESPACE  which may be slightly less trivial to replace

This is confusing. See for example https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/742#issuecomment-209811934.  Currently  JabRef uses  info  for errors and warnings  too:  ![grabbed_20160414-125653](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/14525943/6040e82e-0240-11e6-8916-1c1dda2da3d2.png)  The synchronized message is a debug message  which should not be shown in the general case.  To be consistent with the current logging approach  I changed the log level for a message from  info  to  debug . This also reduces clutter in the log and on the console.   The alternative is to rethink all log levels and the preferred default output.

Moreover  #1080 and #1153 are fixed.  In detail  the following things were changed: - The abstract  ImportFormat  class is almost completely rewritten. Please have a look at this class. Almost all other changes are a direct consequence of the edits made to the ImportFormat class. The biggest change is that the import method returns a  ParserResult  instead of a list of entries (in this way  metadata can also be imported and error messages are communicated more effectively instead of throwing IOExceptions). Moreover  the import method operates on a reader instead of an input stream in order to reduce some common code in all importers. -  Add method  importDatabase(Path file  Charset encoding)  to the importer interface which opens the file and passes the stream to the other import method. - The BibTexImporter overwrites this new import method and uses the logic from  OpenDatabaseAction.loadDatabase  to determine the encoding of the bib file. - Change OpenDatabaseAction to operate against the BibTex importer.  - Remove get/set isCustomImporter: was not really used (just for sorting - now everything is alphabetical) - Empty entries are no longer imported (thus a few test had to be changed)  Remark: The methods getExtension and getDescription are not implemented by almost any importer. This should be done. Maybe this is something for the stupro?

Now  replace is used instead of replaceAll so fewer backslashes and (theoretically) a bit faster.  I also added benchmarking for the following conversions: - HTML to LaTeX (used at import  cleanup and save action) - LaTeX to HTML (used for preview) - LaTeX to Unicode (used for table rendering)   and I got a slight improvement  although I cannot really tell why the two latter are faster now as they are based on cleaned versions... One reason might be that the tests are based on LaTeX symbols with more backslashes in them for the old case...

The current solution was surprisingly easy so far (despite what I had written before). It looks explicitly for our encoding prefix in the file ( Encoding:  ) and kills lines that contain it (but only lines preceding an entry  it will not delete something that is inside an entry). Other user comments are left untouched and are _always_ written out again  even if the entry is reformatted.  User comments that are above meta data  bibtex strings  or the preamble will still be removed  though. Changing that would require large scale changes to these items in our model  since we would also need to store the parsed serialization for them  which we do not do so far.  This should receive significant automated  but also manual  testing  since it modifies a quite critical part and has the potential to destroy bib files.

A db with 6000 entries and a huge amount of groups was no problem with these improvements. Build available under http://builds.jabref.org/improveGroupPerformance/  Results of further performance investigations: - Conversion to lowercase of the field name in BibEntry.getField is the most expensive method for loading and showing a db (2 sek self-time for big db). Changing to TreeMap (with case-insensitive option) or Apache s CaseInsensitiveMap resulted in no improvement.  - Disabling  Show number of group hits  further improves perfomance. - But the KeywordGroup match algorithm is pretty fast. The problem is that we run through the whole list of groups every time one entry changes  we could be smarter here.  - Biggest performance hit for the group tree is now the actual rendering. - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)

For a big file (> 7000 entries  > 100 groups) the load time decreased by 1 sec from 4.8 seconds to 3.7. Half of the time needed for showing the groups tree is spent in calculating the number of hits. Moreover  subsequent rerendings of the groups tree (for example after changing an entry) are also quicker.  Note that the match algorithm changed slightly. For example  previously looking for  test  in  some$test  resulted in a match  this is no longer the case. However  normal word separators (like whitespace  comma and semicolon are recognized properly)  i.e. searching for  test  in  some test  returns true.

This is useful in generating a database from an aux file and for generating a database based on an OO/LO document. It could also be useful for generating a subdatabase from selected entries (or copying relevant strings when copying entries).  There are some problems though related to the preamble. In OO/LO the entries may come from several databases and there it is not obvious how to deal with the preamble. However  a possibly solvable problem is to detect which strings are used in the preamble.  In AuxParserTest @stefan-kolb have generated a test file with a string in the preamble. JabRef doesn t parse this in a way such that the string can be resolved automatically. Earlier  the preamble and all strings were copied in AuxParser  but I was hoping to only copy the relevant strings. Any input on how the preamble issue should be solved? One way would simply be to parse the preamble for strings  I guess.

In this way  we can make sure that all symbols makes sense (some of the current one were incorrect). Also relates to #1761 which is not currently included.  I note two thing:  1) using  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}  did only work for accented characters. I had a version where I printed the Unicode character in the table  but that only rarely worked  although they appeared nicely in the .tex-file 2) Packages and fonts are a bit of a mystery. It may be that with a better font and maybe a few more packages  more symbols are shown.

I also changed the copied version string to include JabRef  Java and OS version so it is the same as in the master branch.  ![screen shot 2016-09-10 at 14 59 58](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15340757/18410967/064bbac6-776e-11e6-8796-2676b1a0a394.png) - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

However  there should be no major performance decline since the query parsing is quite fast and for the actual search in the end the same code gets called. - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

It integrates the changes from #1964 and turns the different special fields into enum values. The different classes composing special fields are now aligned to our architecture. The enum  SpecialField  has to go to  logic  as it involves quite some localization.  There are still some possible improvements based on this PR  in particular: - Outsourcing localization from  SpecialField  so that this class can be moved into  model  (this is not necessarily needed  though) - Rewriting  SpecialFieldsUtil   which is already marked as deprecated.  To maintain a reasonable scope for this PR  these improvements should be done in separate new PRs. They should now also be much simpler based on the new structure. - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef

When using required fields only  this works perfectly. When in biblatex mode  JabRef does not display the value of  journal  in the required fields  because JabRef demands the field  journaltitle . This is not only confusing for me  but also for other users: #2209.  I know that a clean solution is #521. This  however  won t happen this year.  I also know that a bibtex-to-biblatex converter and biblatex-to-bibtex converter is another solution. This  however  forces users to run these when copying and pasting between databases. This could be solved by running these converters silently when copying and pasting. When JabRef is used in parallel to other software (such as Notepad++)  this does not help. I cannot force everyone to use JabRef. Thus  simply supporting  journal  in JabRef is the solution for me.   The biblatex manual states:  > journal field (literal) > An alias for journaltitle  provided for BibTeX compatibility. See § 2.2.2.  Thus  it is not deprecated  but an alias and should IMHO be considered as full alternative for  journaltitle .  <s>I am aware that this patch makes it hard for users using full biblatex with  journaltitle  instead of  journal . I am assuming that not much users are aware of the different modes of JabRef and that they switch back and forth for the same file or for the bibentries.</s>  We now show both  journaltitle  and  journal  if these fields exists in as required fields.

I wanted to rename  XMP-metadata  to  XMP data   but  XMP-metadata  appears in JabRef much more often. Thus  I decided to keep  XMP-metadata  and just adapt two other strings to that writing.

The last implementation used  EntryConverter.FIELD_ALIASES_LTX_TO_TEX . This implementation is based on  BibtexEntryTypes  and  BiblatexEntryTypes .   ## Issue  JabRefPreferences.CUSTOM_TAB_NAME_num_  should be used to really determine the fields to check. This  however  is really a **huge** architectural rework.  It has to be checked  in following (seldom) situation:  - Field X is defined in JabRef s BiblatexEntryTypes - Field X is added by the user to a general tab  JabRef now complains that X is Biblatex only.  ## Further changes  * ISBN and ISBN are now BibTeX fields  too.    - Reason: Even though  both are not listed in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) and the [lncs style](ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/splncs03.bst)  I see them so hard tied to a book and article  that I would add it. In the case of a DOI  JabRef (more or less) enforces it by offering that field in the  General  tab. Moreover  [it is part of plainnat.bst](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/52046/9075) and [natbib](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/natbib) is a popular package.  *  FieldName.COMMENT  instead of  FieldName.COMMENTS  (affects OaiImporter only)  * Preferences: Use FieldName constants at  setLanguageDependentDefaultValues()   - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [n/a] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [n/a] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [n/a] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

2420;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;Remove the redundant worker interface;This is a refactoring PR (yeah  I know we do not really want pure refactoring PRs for now)  and it is open for discussion (I will not throw a tantrum if it does not get merged).  I ran into the  Worker  interface  which does really nothing but extend the  Runnable  interface. I fail to see the point in this additional level of indirection. The  Worker  interface is supposed to mark tasks that should not be executed on the EDT  but there is nothing in the interface to actually maintain that apart from a comment line. All code using the  Worker  depends on the object being a  Runnable   the  Worker  aspect is basically ignored  as there is nothing to consider in the first place.   Instead  there is class  AbstractWorker  which implements the  Worker  aka  Runnable  interface and actually does provide the support for executing the task off the EDT.  AbstractWorker  is the class that is actually used in most of the code and it works just as fine if you have it implement  Runnable  directly.  Therefore  in the spirit of science  I suggest to apply Occam s razor and to use the simplest solution (remove the additional indirection of  Worker ).

This was really hard to track down. It was not a problem in our conversion maps  but in  LatexToUnicode . The ultimate reason is that this code is just an utter mess of hacks and I could only fix this by adding another ugly map on top of this heap.  We have already identified this class to cause performance issues and  as you can see here  it is very difficult to maintain. We should consider removing the functionality and rewriting it from scratch or (preferably) replace it with an external library. After all  converting a LaTeX string to Unicode seems sufficiently well-defined that there is some library for this out there.  - [X] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [X] Tests created for changes - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef

It increases complexity and reduces performance in the unicode conversion a tiny bit (through the additional checks that are now in there).

Thus here I m with a new groups-related PR.  Previously there was the option to automatically generate a bunch of groups. For example based on the keywords contained in a certain field. However  this process was a one-time thing  which means that once the groups were created they were not keep in sync with changes to the entries. In this PR  I introduce the automatic groups as a new type of groups that based on a certain criteria automatically create subgroups and keep them synchronized with the changes.  The current implementation has a few caveats which I would like to address in a new PR: - Automatic groups are not yet written to the bib file (and parsed). - The update process only happens if you switch between databases and the groups tree is reinitialized.  - The UI in the groups edit dialog is probably not the greatest...  Remark: Our architecture tests threw a NPE instead of a meaningful message in case of an issue. This is also fixed.  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [x] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

Few questions here @koppor and all others:  - [x] If keyword sync is enabled  there is the possibility that we have multiple  rank1  rank4  keywords. Only the first one is synched with the special field. Was this always like this? Seems like a bug to me.   - [x] If we change the preferences from write special fields to file to keyword synchronization the data gets lost. Did I introduce this or was this a bug?

However  IllegalArgumentException is a runtime exception and so it was easy to miss that one should catch this exception properly. Fixed by introducing the checked exception InvalidFieldValueException.  In the longer term  we should probably replace this check completely by the integrity checker.

For the error console  I took the suggestion https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2667#issuecomment-288742546 by @matthiasgeiger. The freezing after a Swing message occurred since  ̀ LOGGER.warn( No localized message exception message defined. Falling back to getMessage(). )   lead to recursive calls (actually  Log4j has some logic to prevent deadlocks but these don t take effect since the original message is thrown in the Swing thread  while the above  no localized messsage  is posted in the JavaFX thread.). I simply changed it to log level  debug   which effectively hides it in most cases. As a positive side effect  the scroll issue mentioned in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2667#issuecomment-288714639 is also fixed.  <!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ... -->  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

The new format of the groups leads to a NPE.  As a way out  I changed the tag for the groups tree from  groupstree  to  group  ( groups  was already used by previous version way back). Thus older versions completely ignore the group tree and no longer try to parse it  so no NPE is thrown. On the downside  however  the groups tree is deleted upon save in the older version.

I actually just wanted to have a look at the autocompletion and use some built-in JavaFX functionality for it. However  just changing the JTextarea s to their JavaFX equivalent wasn t possible since the editor components (additional buttons next to the text area) required JTextareas. Thus  eating the foul egg (= Easter version of  in den sauren Apfel beißen )  I started to migrate the whole entry editor to JavaFX. So far only the DOI component is re-implemented.  Points to notice: - Using JavaFX bindings  there is no longer the need to manually update the entry after a changed happened. This should fix these nasty bugs that sometimes changes in the editor got lost when performing a different action. Moreover  the main table is instantly updated with the changes in the editor. - I opted for a slightly different architecture. Previously  there were the text field and additional components. Now these are combined into one FieldEditor. - As for the groups interface  I will continue slowly to reimplement the other field editors. - The style is not that different from the Swing version. For the buttons  I only used images: ![snipimage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5037600/25102492/f8b61756-23b8-11e7-8024-e9ff48b132c5.JPG)  ------   - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

I removed this as I think nobody really knew about it in the first place and moreover it also takes 2 clicks to select the current date with the calendar popup.  There are still some layout problems (small width  additional empty line below it) that are probably a result of the mixed Swing and JavaFX stuff. Hopefully  this will be resolved more or less automatically if also the background tab pane is converted to JavaFX.   - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

2995;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;Less backups;Addresses #2993  The frequent events are due to the bidirectional binding which transfers every change directly into the BibEntry. If we want fewer events  the only solution will probably be to break the binding  which would be very disappointing for the JavaFX implementation. In my point of view the problem is not on the side of event creation. After all  every change should trigger an event and JavaFX triggers many changes. Imho  this should be fixed in how we react to events.  I also noticed the exception  but do not get a dialog. This seems to happen because of the save operation invoked by the backup.  A solution might be to do less backups  by:  1. Doing backups only every X events and not for every event  2. Ignoring FieldChangeEvents in the Backup  3. Adding the size of the field change in the FieldChangeEvent class  so that you can ignore it if only 1 character changed.  This PR combines options 1. and 3.  i.e.: The backup manager ignores events that are very minor and only does a backup if enough of them have happened (currently set to five).

It fixes a bug that I ve only noticed locally and discussed with @tobiasdiez in chat. There s no issue for it  but the fix comes directly here.  If you have save actions configured (say LatexToUnicode) and the backup triggers too early (say after 5 characters) then the BackupManager interrupts you if you add a longer command in the entry edior (say  \alpha ). With this PR  the BackupManager is no longer triggered every five characters  but only if there are changes of more than one character (a user pastes text into the entry editor) or if the user edits a different field than before. This seems way more reasonable to me and is as it has been before (only backups when a user changes the field  edits a group  etc.)  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

In detail  when  EntryEditor  opens up  it is not focused automatically. The desired behavior is to focus the first  Textfield  on any of the  EntryEditor  s tabs.  The way the fix is implemented: when  EntryEditor  is opened  the  JFXPanel  in which is the  TabPane  of the  EntryEditor  is getting the focus  The focus is given implicitly to a focusTraversable node contained in the  JFXPanel . The selection of the node seems to be  random  (even though consistent for a given tree of nodes). As far as I ve tested it consistently focuses the first  Textfield  on any tab  which is the desired behavior. I make this pull requested as suggested in #3052 discussion by @Siedlerchr .  I should mention that I ran  gradle check  which results in  6 tests failed  in my setup but this was also the result when I ran the test before making any change.  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

For some reason  I did not manage to get this working when the source tab takes care of deregistration. Therefore  I moved all event handling out of the source tab and into the entry editor.  Using jvisualvm  I can see that garbage collection works with this PR. Cycling through the main table with the entry editor open increases used RAM. When you force garbage collection  the used heap goes down to close to zero again  instead of staying at a higher plateau. See attached screenshot  ![heap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515701/29381572-f60537f6-82c9-11e7-9ad9-20e6208ca648.png)  So this fixes the memory leak.

The reason for this is that Java tries to fit them in the available display space. Examples: #3130 #3117 #2941  This PR sets a minimum size for all TextAreas in the EntryEditor. The value of 70px is rather arbitrary and I ll be happy to get some thoughts if this is good or if more or less is desirable. With this minimum size all TextAreas are nicer to read  even in the cramped up General tab. The only  problem  is that you now need to scroll in the General tab most of the time.   All in all I think this should definitly go into 4.0!  - [X] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

So this turns off validation in the entry editor. We can add the UI to turn it on later  when the display bug in controlsfx has been fixed.

On top of that  I found the the source tab isn t integrated in the undo framework at all  so I have added this as well. However  it doesn t work problem-free. It seems that the FX CodeArea consumes undo events as well. So when you hit undo in the sourcetab  the CodeArea does the undo and then the UndoManager tries to do it again and fails. It has no consequence  though  apart from an exception  the undo happens anyway.  Since this is an improvement (add undo to source tab again)  I would like to merge this even if it s not perfect. I have zero time to dig deeper into these FX problems  and I assume that no one else will do it. So  we can just merge the current state.   - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

It is based on two dummy entries  where source is cross referencing target. 2. It reads the database from mentioned example bib file: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/test/resources/testbib/crossref.bib and asserts cross reference of two given entries.   _Watchout_ - I was not able to clean code method  assertSourceCrossrefsTarget  further due to the  Optional<>  concept. - I wrote a small TestDataBuilder  BibEntryBuild.  It is an inner class  because I am uncertain where to put it. - I wrote an crossref.bib-encapsulating class  DatabaseFromFile  to keep test code readable. It is an inner class  because I did not find a similar wrapper nor did I know where to put it. Its construction uses a path to a file to be parsed to a database.

The only difference between logging in the FallbackExceptionHandler to other loggings of errors was the direct usage of  log4j  instead of the usual  LogFactory  approach. Thus I changed it to the later and hope for the best.  While touching the telemetry  I also added logging of the creation of new entries and the created entry type.

The offered PR implements functionality discussed in my  File linking functionality update?  proposal (http://discourse.jabref.org/t/file-linking-functionality-update/723). It is now possible to use bracketed expressions (like  [bibtexkey]  or  [year]\_[auth]\_[firstpage] ) consistently in:  - BibTex key generator patterns  - File search regular expressions (for automatic file linking)  - Import file name patterns  - Import directory patterns.  To maintain consistent formatting  I have created a new BracketedExpressionExpander class which provides its main methods   expandBrackets() . They essentially contain all bracket expansion functionality moved from BibtexKeyPatternUtil  and the BibtexKeyPatternUtil class now extends BracketedExpressionExpander  and uses its static methods. The BracketedExpressionExpander is also used in FileUtil and RegExpBasedFileFinder  avoiding the previous duplication of functionality in BibtexKeyPatternUtil.makeLabel(...) and RegExpBasedFileFinder.getFieldAndFormat(...) methods (both now use BracketedExpressionExpander.expandBrackets() for dealing with *all* aspects of bracket expansion in one place).

To retain functionality that was previously implemented by the  \entrytype  Layout pattern  a new bracketed expression  [entrytype]  was created and tested. It is suggested that Layout manager is used exclusively for describing layouts in citation lists  and bracketed expressions are used for describing file system and database entry patterns.  The functionality was tested under LinuxMint 18.1 and Ubuntu 16.04. Unfortunately  I could not test it on Windows hosts since I do not have any of them available for Java testing. I have put in provisions to deal with both  /  and  \  directory separators in Directory Patterns  but I would be grateful if someone checks them on a Windows system.  Sincerely  Saulius

I tried around a lot with directly implementing native messaging using Java. It worked in principle but was really unstable (everything JabRef wrote in the command line made crashed Firefox). Thus  in the end  I went for a simple powershell script that handles the  native messaging  stuff and converts it to simple command line arguments. As a positive side effect  you can now specify Bibtex code for import directly as a command line argument.  I also took the opportunity to slightly improve the code concerning with the remote listener (the old version didn t allowed arguments with line breaks to be passed).   The installation routine still needs to be automated and this is where I need help. @Siedlerchr @koppor could you please have a look at the following things: -  Copy [jabref.json](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/nativeMessaging/buildres/jabref.json)  [JabRef.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JabRef/jabref/nativeMessaging/buildres/JabRef.bat) and [JabRef.ps1](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/nativeMessaging/buildres/JabRef.ps1) to the same directory as  JabRef.exe . - Make sure that the correct file name of the JabRef  .jar  file is specified in  JabRef.ps1  under  $jabRefJarFileName . - Run  REG ADD  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\org.jabref.jabref  /ve /d  C:\path\to\jabref.json  /f  from the console (with the correct path to the  jabref.json  file).

This class is still a bit ugly but in my opinion better than before. I hope that the conflict handling still works as expected.

3327;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;Fix location bundle with fast access;This PR addresses the issue I mentioned under [Localization memory](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3187#issuecomment-337464813). To provide a reasonable implementation and not only a bugfix I had to change the layout. These things bothered me the most:  -  LocalizationBundle  and  Localization  were calling each other. We needed  Localization  to create the keys in the bundle and on the other hand  the  LocalizationBundle  was only used in the  Localization  class -  Localization  seemed like a quick fix to provide messages as bundle to Java FX - On each call to any function in these classes  the unescaping of messages was done again. This  in particular  was the reason why showed up as hot spot in the profiler  To unify the implementation  I based the complete  Localization  framework on two instances (menus and messages) of  LocalizationBundle  and made this an internal class as it should not be used without it. The bundles are (re)created when  setLanguage  is called and contain the unescaped keys and messages for the specified language as a fast hash table.  This enables two things: (1) We can pass the  LocalizationBundle  instance directly to Java FX with  getMessages  and since we only pass the reference to the hash table  it will be instantaneous. (2) Every call to  lang  or  menuTitle  is a simple lookup in the hash table and a replacement of possible parameters in the string.  The public API for  Localization   meaning  lang    menuTitle    getMessages  and  setLanguage  did not change and works as expected. During profiling/debugging I noticed  however  that there is a flaw in the JabRef startup. The language is set after the initialization of the preferences. At least one preference setting uses a localized string in a static field. Since when uninitialized  the  Localization  reverts back to  en   these strings will never be in the user language (see [this issue](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3326)). Furthermore  due to this access  the  Localization  framework will always be initialized several times. Once in the init of the preferences and once further down in  main .  This can only be fixed by pushing  setLanguage  to the initialization of the preferences which I did. One additional minor thing was that one message key was used escaped and had to be unescaped. Other than that  this implementation worked out of the box and passed all existing localization tests.  I commented my code heavily and would be glad if someone would review it. Don t forget that I m looking only about 5 days on the code base and it is very likely I have overlooked something.

I reported this in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3335 and @tobiasdiez provided me with the hint how this could work. Against his suggestion to not overshoot  I decided to prove my point that even those small context menus have a significant impact because things will sum up in the end and those menus are newly instantiated for every visible field in the editor.  The starting point was the current master-branch and profiling it by going through only 50 bib-entries. This means that the context menus are instantiated for the visible text fields. This has an impact on performance and memory and  unfortunately  it is not only a tiny fraction.   ## Memory  Notable are the columns  Objects   which are all objects that are created by this method and underlying sub calls and the overall  Size .  ![mem1](http://i.imgur.com/pjBJSlF.png)  With almost 40% of the overall memory size  it s definitely something to look into.  ## Performance  The performance is with 8% not so large but still noticeable.   ![perf1](http://i.imgur.com/STSGgNj.png)  ## Fixing it  By using the  Supplier  interface  we can move the instantiation to the point where the user actually right-clicks into the field. I debugged this  and it seems to work nice. The outcome was as expected. Since no one actually triggers the context menu by just browsing through the list  it vanished altogether. Here is the used memory with this PR created by exactly scrolling through the 50 entries.

More precisely  the code that was used to determine the differences between two databases now resides in logic  while the rest went to the gui package (one might try to extract even more code to logic but this is a first good start in my opinion).   I tried to not change the functionality. This of course means that I tried not to introduce bugs (although I m sure there will be small glitches) but it also implies that I didn t improved the code too much. If somebody has time  he or she is really invited to have a look at the feature. Many things are not yet implemented (e.g. a real metadata difference) and the ui is just ugly.   However  there is one thing which did changed: previously it was a kind of 3-way merge between the last saved version  the current state and the external changes to the bib file. However  the current state was taken into account only sometimes (and sometimes in the wrong way). Thus I removed this part completely and moved to a 2-way merge between the last saved version and the external changes. In rare cases  this might lead to an unnecessary notification of external changes (namely exactly when the external changes coincide with what the user changed since the last save).   If you merge  it probably preferable to not smash the commits.  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

The problem was that updates to the editor were not performed on the javafx thread although they were wraped in a  runInJavaFXThread  call. The reason was that this method would actually submit tasks to the executor  which would then start a new thread. So the fix only happens in  DefaultTaskExecutor   the rest of the changes are minor cosmetic improvements to get rid of globals or base panels in the source tab.  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

It uses [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX)  which seems to be a good framework for javafx gui tests. For example  it is possible to run the unit tests in a headless method - thus allowing it to run on travis. For me  the biggest advantage is that you can isolate different parts of the system (i.e. only add the source tab) and ignore the rest of the application. Thus you can write  unit tests for ui .  Disclaimer: I will not invest any more work in these gui tests. But since some of you were quite in favor of having a gui test suite  I thought I share with you what I have so far.  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

Since  localizationUpdate  seems broken  the messages are currently not added and I m waiting for the fix.The logic behind the java check is as follows:  1. In  gradle.build  we can define the  minRequiredJavaVersion  which is added as a value to  build.properties  as this was the most fitting place and it makes the version check quite flexible. I did not use an upper bound for the version but a boolean  allowJava9  indicator. The reasoning behind it is that a developer who is actually working on the Java 9 support just has to change this value to make JabRef start. 2. I put the version check as a method into  BuildInfo . Other possible places would be  Globals  or when we give the build-info as a parameter then  JavaVersionCheck  itself. Suggestions? 3. The version check is called pretty early in  main  (as soon as localization is set up). I didn t bother to put the single error dialog into a separate class. Therefore  the logic of checking  showing the message and probably exiting is done directly there. Is this acceptable?  The version check itself has the only requirement to successfully access  System.getProperty( java.version ) . I implemented a very *optimistic* check that doesn t fail if we cannot determine or compare the versions. Only if we are sure that the used version is not sufficient  it will fail.  This will solve https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3310

Thinking hard about how to reintroduce the necessary amount of bugs  I hereby propose to rework the entry editor toolbar using JavaFX.   Before: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/33519852-e35fbd2a-d7af-11e7-8982-93530fc0599a.png)  After: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/33519858-072366f8-d7b0-11e7-8a87-1ed5a63b7f23.png)  I tried to clean-up the ui as much as possible by removing a few buttons and changing the size/space. The following buttons were removed: - all buttons that do not have a global effect on the whole entry but are concerned with a specific field    -  generate bibtex key  moved to the key field in the entry editor    -  find linked files  removed completely (it was not working anyway  and nobody complained)    -  write metadata to pdf  moved to file field -  help : removed completely (since otherwise there was not enough space to have a nice display of the type label)  Other changes: - left click on type label shows  change type menu  - the entry editor contained some (unused) code that checked the bibtex key for duplication and validity. I extracted the code and turned it into new integrity checkers.  ---  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

3443;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;Fix for issue #3381;Because the javafx Tooltip used in the [GlobalSearchBar](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/search/GlobalSearchBar.java) cannot render HTML  @tobiasdiez recommended in #3381  to create a TextFlow object in the [SearchDescriber](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/search/rules/describer/SearchDescriber.java) classes for structuring the Text.   I made the changes to return a TextFlow and its working fine so far without changing the logic that is used to build the text.  I moved the search.rules.describer package like proposed from the logic package to the gui package. The existing tests were moved accordingly but still needs to be rewritten for the new TextFlow results.  There are some open questions i would like to ask:  1. With no Styling of the Tooltip  the readability was really bad (black text on grey background)  so I changed the styling to look like the other Tooltips in the bar. Hope it was okay to do this in the context of this issue? I created a new styleclass for this in the Main.css to not change any other styled elements. 2. the [SearchQuery](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/search/SearchQuery.java) class stores a description of the search. It is created with the SearchDescribers. But they are now inside the gui package and return a TextFlow. So there is a javafx dependency in the SearchQuery class which resides in the logic package at the moment. This doesnt sound right to me? Should the class be moved to the gui package too? 3. The [GroupDialog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/groups/GroupDialog.java) class uses a SearchQuery object to get a search description. This class is written with Swing and is not compatible to the now returned TextFlow. If I understand it right  the project is migrating to use javaFX. So I want to propose that I write a compatibility method in the GroupDialog class to create an HTML string from the given TextFlow to be compatible while the GroupDialog is still using Swing.  4. Sadly the localized strings used in the SearchDescribers included the HTML tag elements.. So in many cases it is not possible to use existing translations.. just because the tags are gone. I m not sure what to do about this. It could be possible to remove the tags manually from the translations. Not sure how long this would take..  That s how the tooltip looks with the changes: ![screenshot-2017-11-18--13 15 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4948016/32980197-9c017e62-cc62-11e7-86a6-b5c0c0010ac8.png)  There seems to be something wrong with the logic of the tooltip text creation  the first few words repeat itself. And it already happened prior to my changes (see the image in #3381) But I didnt had time to look very closely into this. Should I open a new issue for this problem?  I hope I didn t forget anything.

So far the code is only a prototype  but it already works really well. What is missing is that changes in the aux file are automatically recognized and handled (this should be easy to accomplish). The user interface is very very basic and only contains a text field where the user can specify the path to the aux file (in light of the upcoming rewrite of the groups dialog in javafx #2643  I don t want to spent to much time at ui stuff).   I have two questions: - ~~The implementation so far is against our architecture. The new group ( TexGroup ) is in the model but uses the  AuxParser  from the logic. Any ideas how to resolve this issue? More and more  I don t like the strict rule that model is not allowed to access logic - how I m supposed to create  intelligent  objects in the model if they are not allowed to use advanced stuff from the logic package?~~  - The file path right now is stored as an absolute path. Is this ok? If not  what should be the  base  of a relative path? The bib file?  ---  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

Unfortunately  we also use libraries that make such internal accesses and we need to find a solution for that.  One of these libraries is swingx. Originally by Sun  it is no longer maintained since quite a while we could not even upgrade to the newest version  because of bugs in the library. It is time to get rid of this dependency. This PR replaces the usage of swingx with regular Swing components. Only the new entries dialog and the side pane are affected. For the new entries dialog  the change is trivial (just using a regular layout manager). For the side pane  a few changes are needed  but I can make it roughly resemble the old layout.   There s one bigger change  though  that I happen to like very much: The side panes are no longer exclusive  you can display them together. That means that I can have the web search and the groups panel open at the same time. Personally  I think that s pretty cool and I would like to keep it that way. You can of course still disable the side panes independent of each other. Here s a screenshot: ![sidepane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515701/33206932-2e6bd6fa-d10c-11e7-96b2-58f28f0f3bee.png)  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ?

This discussion should be continued here.   There were two situations I have presented a design approach:  1. The linked file has no annotations 2. The linked file has annotations  If there are annotations in the linked file  two design solution approaches have been discussed: Either realising it with a list or a table. No matter which of these solutions is chosen  it would be nice to be able to order the annotations by Date  Author or Page. - So a table might be the clearest solution.  - Sorting a list on the other hand side could be realised by implementing a DropDown Menu were the user can select what the list should be sorted by.  I implemented the  No Annotations  approach  so that the right side of the FileAnnotationTab showing the annotation s attributes is either disabled (if there are  no annotations  in the linked file) or enabled (if there are annotations).

This PR proposes to   1. update the description of how to add new strings 2. update the tests to enable the translations being a subset of the existing translations.  After each sync  the translation will reappear. So we have a short time window where the translations are missing and that translators using GitHub do not see these new translations. I would accept that.  News: We have 17 new Indonesian translations  because a guy just translated some strings there at Crowdin. 🎉

The code is more than 12 years old and almost as bad as the bibtex parser used to be.  This PR is based on two decisions:  - I do not want to change the old layouting code. If I do  I am almost guaranteed to break it in many ways. - I do not know if the removal of empty lines in exported text is really desirable in all cases. Maybe users wrote their custom formatters to explicitly include empty lines? I cannot tell.  We now have one case (RIS export) where empty lines are not desired. So  I implemented a solution that only changes the behavior of the RIS export  but leaves all others untouched. Nonetheless  it is very easy (single constructor parameter) to let other formats use empty line elimination as well.   The empty line elimination is done using a hardly understandable  but fully functional regex.   ----  - [X] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

These actions are usually defined in the base panel (or main frame). - Now the visual elements are defined by an  ActionFX  (to be renamed to  Action  as soon as the old class can be removed) and the behavior by implementing the  Command  interface. This separation makes it possible to reuse the visual aspects without the ties to the behavior. - In the long term  the commands should be defined outside of the main big classes.

The main reason for putting it out right now is to test if pushing the migration further fixes the issues encountered with Linux and MacOS. @Siedlerchr @LinusDietz could you please try out this version and see if JabRef starts and shows a maintable (the latter only works if JabRef normally opens a bib file for you  since there is currently no GUI to open a new file).  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

This is a fix to issue #3679  Fixes #3679   * When clicking the  Cancel  button in the file link deletion dialog  the file  was being deleted from the list.

I m not sure about using  compareSingleField  function for comparing chapters  because sometimes they are very similar  but different  for instance:  chapter 1  and  chapter 2 . Any idea? My is to remove  chapter  word from strings and then make the comparison.  2. Should I also add test for incollections? 3. What about pages? As I noticed they can be a replacement for chapters. Should I consider them in the code? 4. Can I add another commits with some cleanup and refactor for the files I ve touched? I mean adding some finals to make code less error prone etc.

This is really not meant as a final say  it just moves the code in place for some buttons that seem of some value for me. They can be removed again  resorted  and the layout is probably also not perfect.

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. -->  This PR adds a dark theme. Based on the wonderful work of @halirutan  this was really easy and only a handful of colors had to be changed.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/37995234-fc2cadcc-3213-11e8-8408-480c70263317.png) The highlight color is taken from the icon that won the design contest last year. In the end  the dark theme is more a Spielerei from my side to test how nicely the JavaFX styling works and I definitely think we should provide a light theme as the default.  The dark theme was also a nice test because it revealed a few 1-px wide borders  shadows and other small stuff. Based on these discoveries  I also changed the light theme a bit. These changes are just a proposal and are open for discussion. In my opinion  the light theme still needs a bit of love until it is finished (e.g. I find the side pane should be colored in a darker color to better distinguish it from the main table and the background color of the header looks a bit  dirty .)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/37995195-d85e3fbe-3213-11e8-97a3-1cb3e7aa77f9.png)   ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

This initial commit adds a button to the settings panel for each external application which allows the user to select an application to make default.

Following the DiVA ID type classes as template  an RFC fetcher class and fetcher test has been added. I added RFC to the ID-based entry generator list within WebFetchers so it is an option in the dialog s dropdown.  Currently  the RFC fetcher class accepts search requests with or without the  rfc  prefix--is this an okay feature?

If it s on Windows  the  \r\n  will be replaced with a whitespace  and it is OK. However if we encounter  .\r\n   the  .\r  will be reserved and the  \n  will be replaced by a whitespace. In this way  the  .\r  will not be shown as new line int the field  and we don t need this whitespace. So instead we should change  .\r\n  to  \r\n  directly.  So I use java s  %n  to distinguish new line wisely.  # Font size of summary on the left changed to 10px  # Summary text wrapped  # The Final example:  <img src= https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upupming/paste/master/img/changed-file-notation.png />   <!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Hi  I m trying to fix the issue #3959   and I have some problems here. Can someone help me?  **1. Some tests don t seem to have a parameter source** Such as   BibTeXMLExporterTest.java    MSBibExportFormatTestFiles.java    ModsExportFormatTestFiles.java   and so on. Since I can t get feedback from both Travis CI and my IDE  I couldn t do anything at the moment. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997706-ee482a88-9e15-11e8-9b43-9b9f9853c150.png)   **2. Something about the external libraries** For  MainArchitectureTestsWithArchUnit.java     testCompile  com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit:0.8.3   **isn t enough for migrate this test to JUnit 5.** Just a few days ago   ArchUnit  just supported tests with only JUnit 5 package. But this feature needs a  testCompile  com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit:0.9.0  and as far as I know  this version has not been released yet. For  CiteKeyBasedFileFinderTest.java   I haven t found an extension in JUnit 5 for the  MockitoJUnitRunner.class  in JUnit 4. And it seems that their (mock) official version hasn t been release yet  too.   **3. The Database Test** As I can see  those tests have already been migrated partly to JUnit 5. But the rest of it is the PROBLEM. I ve tried to migrate  DBMSProcessorTest.java    but the code is no longer concise after that. For example   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997780-26078368-9e18-11e8-9fce-43d293fedf88.png) this is the old version  and ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997784-3e0ae356-9e18-11e8-8073-d43eeb12f0d5.png) that is the new version. And that is only part of it. The reason is that I couldn t pass the parameters to the  @BeforeEach  method in JUnit 5  but JUnit 4 can use those local variable to pass the parameters. I think this is where the difference occurred.   **4. The GUI Test** I just change the  @Category  annotation to  @Tag  annotation  as I have known that those tests are mostly obsolete.   **5. About CleanupWorkerTest** This test is not hard to migrate from JUnit 4 to 5. But when I finish  and run the tests on my IDE  two tests failed. And the error message is quite weird. It seems that the worker doesn t work in JUnit 5 tests. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997847-be8c685a-9e19-11e8-9c3a-a911d9daeafe.png)   And if there are any errors or something can be improved in other tests that I didn t mention  please let me know!

I originally had this in the cleanupSingleString method to prevent KEY_FIELD from being cleaned up (reformatted) entirely  but decided to let the user specifically format that field.  When the user chooses to format all fields at once  however  the KEY_FIELD will be not be reformatted. This solves issue [#4148](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4148)

Since this is the most essential part of JabRef  I would kindly ask to every @JabRef/developers to have a look at the code (at least on the new  AtomicOutputStream  which does the hard work).  The new strategy for saving the bib file is as follows: - Create a backup (with .bak suffix) of the original file in the same directory as the destination file (if set in preferences). - Write to a temporary file (with .tmp suffix) in the same directory. - Create a save-backup (with .sav suffix) of the original file (if it exists) in the same directory. - Move the temporary file to the correct place  overwriting any file that already exists at that location. - Delete the save-backup file.  What is not clear to me is how one should handle (almost) concurrent saving processes of different users to the same file. Is it enough to lock a file ( nio.FileLock ) and if yes  which (the tmp?)?  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

Link issues by using the following pattern: [#333](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/333) or [koppor#49](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/47).      The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Potential fix for [#4306](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4306).  The method   performNameConflictCheck   added in   LinkedFileViewModel   helps check whether or not the filename is already equal to the suggested filename. If so  it returns true  otherwise  it returns false. This method is then called in   LinkedFilesEditor   during   createContextMenuForFile()   to decide whether or not the Rename  Move  or Rename and Move menu options are to be disabled.  The method itself works as I tested it by running the code live with the JVM. Having the filename == suggested filename indeed disabled those three menu options in the context menu. The issue however  is that I m having trouble writing my test case for it. I m running into a couple of nullpointers being thrown when I try to run my test case   checkNameConflict()   in   LinkedFileViewModelTest  . Specifically  it reports that there are nullpointers when accessing the   getSuggestedFilename()   called in within   checkNameConflict   in the   LinkedFileViewModel   class.  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - ***N/A*** - [ ] Tests created for changes - ***Work In Progress*** - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef  - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) ***N/A*** - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one] (https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

The reason for the freezes were the pull-request https://bitbucket.org/controlsfx/controlsfx/pull-requests/710. These changes mess up the layout for some reason. The fix is to inject a DecorationPane ourselves directly from the beginning. Although this fix started as a workaround for this bug in controlsfx  I think  we should keep it permanently for performance reasons.

So I tried it  and find out an issue that you can not save preference.  Save  button have no response. The issue starts from _Provide access to dark theme in preferences_ (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/4372).   The reason is that default value for key  fxTheme  is not set  thus cause a null exception when access this option. Solution is simple  just to set default value  Base.css  for key  fxTheme  in preference.  Finally  I have to say dark theme is a great job. thanks

To change the preview style  he has to move the selected style to the right column before pressing  Save .  Selecting styles in the right column can be previewed in the test panel. However  the style of bibEntry is not updated after pressing  Test . To rectify this  the citation style is updated in Preferences. To ensure preview style configuration is saved  the chosen preview style is also saved in the Preferences.  Note that if preview style (at the left column) is selected  the configuration will not be saved.  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

Although I like the idea of the dialog  our users simply do not use it. The azure telemetry shows only 35 interactions with the dialog in the past year. Moreover  the dialog is currently broken (you cannot paste anything) and the git logs suggest that it s in this state now for over a year - but we have no user reports about this. Finally  the re-implementation in JavaFX would be a huge effort  which I m not will to invest in view of the low usage numbers.  I would suggest to re-implement some of the features (like automatic bibtex generation using freecite) at a later stage.    ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Fixes issue [#4679](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4679)  This PR fixes the first issue. I could not reproduce the second issue. The item count should now be updated correctly.  The problem was because of the Listener not getting notified when changes were being made. This was due to the weak listener which was attached to ObservableList returned by  databaseContext.getDatabase().getEntries() . https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44341400/whats-the-purpose-of-fxcollections-unmodifiableobservablelist   The only case where this PR might not work is when we are dealing with a library in which there are no groups other than the All Entries [#4441](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4441). That is because the group being utilized in the line  text.textProperty().bind(group.getHits().asString())   in file /gui/groups/GroupTreeView.java is the group All Entries that is present even before you open any library in JabRef. This causes value to not be set properly. But the only time it happens is if the only group you have in the new library is All Entries. Once we are able to fix that  this PR should work in all cases.  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

Removed JabRefFrame.output in favor of FXDialogService.notify and refactored calling code. Added Logging to FXDialogService.notify  Logs seemed to be duplicated afterwards. However  this was another issue with log4j. Because LogEvent-Objects are reused  they were copied in LogMessages.add . But at that point it was too late  resulting in different Log Messages being overwritten. I therefore moved the copying to GuiAppender.append and this resolves the issue of seemingly duplicated log messages.

Before the end of this week  I will add support for nested files and cross-references and will keep improving the related documentation.  Any feedback is more than welcome! **: D**

I understood that in the future JabRefPreference probably need Properties  to make them bindable. But for now I think this goes beyond this PR.  It works as expected. I took the liberty  to add a split-pane between the conents and the tabList to enable the user to change the width between them  so this PR is not just about refactoring the Dialog.  -)  This is very early shot on this matter.

Further debugging showed that the Observable List with the entries in the maintable model does not yet include the new inserted entry  although it s already in the bib database. This is because due to the Bindings.forUI around the list in MainTable  it s run on the FX thread. And the FX thread is blocked/busy with the findEntry method.  I know this was added because of not on fx thread exceptions. But I tested cleanup and external modification of file and it was fine.

When importing RIS files Jabref checks for date fields (Y1 PY DA and Y2) and uses the first one it finds.

However  as already cited in [#4816](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4816)  and by doing some exports we found Y1 to be  PY s synonym  furthermore  when PY received a higher priority than Y1  some tests cases didn t pass as there were a missing month field in .bib.    We established a priority system indicated by the dateTags (lowest index higher priority)  https://github.com/VMichelan/jabref/blob/2f243c16f08f2cfeba6f1ab4651970d90eb55546/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fileformat/RisImporter.java#L31  We added 2 test cases for this and changed one of the old ones adding the month field.  *https://web.archive.org/web/20120717122530/http://refman.com/support/direct%20export.zip ** nicely displayed in: https://github.com/aurimasv/translators/wiki/RIS-Tag-Map  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. -->  This is a huge refactor PR. I m sorry for its size  but I couldn t break it down into smaller pieces. The changes are as follows: - Introduce extended enum  Field  for fields (e.g  StandardField.AUTHOR  instead of the string  author ) and use this everywhere. Besides the name of the field  some basic and universal properties are stored (e.g. whether it is a numeric field) - Introduce the class  BibField  which enriches the  Field  by properties that depend on the entry (type) where this field is used. Right now this is only how important the field is (which should in the long term replace the required/optional dichometry.   - Introduce extended enum  EntryType  for entry types (e.g.  StandardEntryType.ARTICLE  instead of the string  article ) and use this everywhere.  - Introduce the class  BibEntryType  that enriches an  EntryType  by properties that the user can configure (e.g. required fields).  I tried to not change any behavior  except the following things that I noticed while testing: - All fields are now properly sorted alphabetically (in the subgroups of required/optional fields) when the entry is written to the bib file. - Some importers used the field  pubstatus  instead of the standard BibTeX field  pubstate .    ----  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. -->  ### What this PR adds? This PR is related to [koppor#343](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/343).  I added a field formatter called **Shorten DOI** formatter which shortens DOI using http://shortdoi.org service. You run the formatter from _Cleanup entries dialog_ by adding it to _Run field formatter_ list.  It looks to work fine. It enables one way conversion from DOI to short DOI.  ### Implementation details: I assumed that short DOI is still a legal DOI. That s why I adjusted the DOI class to work with short DOIs.  ### Feedback wanted I I d like to ask for your feedback about the code at this stage.  ### Next step - Add a more accessible UI - a toggle button next to the DOI field _shortened/long version_ (This was suggested by @koppor)  This will require adding opposite conversion (from short DOI to DOI). As http://shortdoi.org servcie doesn t offer such a feature I see two approaches:  1. Store the original DOI during the conversion for further back conversion. **Drawback:** You may not convert from short DOI to DOI if you haven t done the opposite conversion for at least one time. 2. Try to obtain DOI from short DOI using https://doi.org service as it is possible by catching the HTTP redirection  I find the 1st approach fine. The 2th approach is not really good as we are not using any public API and this can stop working in the future.  What do you think folks? :)  ### Important If you would like to checkout this branch and test locally please use [shortdoi-workaround](https://github.com/dawidowoc/jabref/tree/shortdoi-workaround) branch which uses workaround by @r0light for issue [#5245](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5245).

The four very simple tabs are converted and I included some suggestions about templates/generics and icons @tobiasdiez made in [#5185 comment](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5185#discussion_r322013878) and in [#5265](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5265#discussion_r320335661).  The SaveOrderConfigDisplay had to be refactored  as there were some bugs: It did not want to set the values after resetting the preferences and it could not load the fields-class (crazy java9-module-stuff)  so I also had to change some exports in the modules-info. There I also included some changes out of the gitter-discussion.  I already got some ideas how to resort all the preferences and options in the options-menu  One could change the ListView on the sidePane to a TreeView and start thinning each tab into small preferenceTabs. The help buttons could also be somehow adjusted for each tab at the same position. (maybe somewhere to the right of the title)  I guess there are some things to be discussed or corected in this PR  so im looking forward for your comments.  ![ExportSorting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925794-1c67c480-d7f6-11e9-9015-5e296a8db0da.png) ![EntryEditor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925795-1c67c480-d7f6-11e9-8778-9ec7df1bc648.png) ![Import](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925796-1c67c480-d7f6-11e9-8f0f-a4c714c6603e.png) ![EntryTable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/64925797-1f62b500-d7f6-11e9-8367-1e3227882188.png)  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

I highly recomment using those methods I added instead of the old ones.  For those that are unfamiliar with the CompletableFuture pattern  they might want to have a look at my personal [project](https://github.com/Brainsucker92/picalculator/blob/master/src/main/java/calculator/impl/ChudnovskyCalculator.java) where I used this to split and chain some very expensive calculations which gave me a very simple but huge increase in throughput.  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

There is no longer a  BasePanel  required to abbreviate BibEntries. Also I split up the relatively big abbreviation task into a lot of smaller tasks  which increase concurrency a lot (divide and conquer FTW!)  Important events during the abbreviation process can now be listened to via the  AbbreviateActionListener  interface or  AbbreviateActionAdapter  class.  Unfortunately I cannot test any of the changes since I don t have any big database to run an abbreviation on. Is there any testing data available?  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

JabRef should store instead in the columnPreferences not the fields  but the columns e.g.  groups  or  special:rank  or  field:author . The result would be  that the user is able to have a clickable uri-column  linked_id  in one column  and in another  field:url  the uri printed out. Also they should finally be reorderable.

5665;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;Improve change scanner;If a file is changed externally  JabRef is doing a 3-way merge between the last saved value vs current value in JabRef vs new value in file. The way this is done is by first comparing the last saved file with the current (changed) file  and then trying to find additional/other changes in the currently open database. This is really complex and I believe there is some subtle bug in the logic leading to #5257.  With this PR  the change scanner is changed to a to simple 2-way merge between the current value in JabRef vs new value in file. This is way simpler and I hope this PR fixes #5257. In a few edge cases  the 2-way merge has a small disadvantage. For example  consider the following steps: - User A opens file - User A changes field  Author  to  User A  and adds field  Title  with value  new  - User B opens file - User B changes field  Author  to  User B  - User B saves file  At this point  User A gets a message that the file changed with the following changes: - field  Author  changed from  User A  to  User B  - field  Title  was removed  The 3-way merge could detect that  Title  was newly added  and thus could automatically reapply this change.  This is no longer possible with the simple 2-way merge.  <!--  Describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...  Link issues by using the following pattern: #333.

5669;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;[WIP] Fix change on disk detection;This will solve the whole change-on-disk-dection things similar as conflicts are solved for a shared-database. This PR builds on https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5640 and is an alternative to https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5665.  ## Implementation motivation  In 2016  I designed the database synchronization feature (https://docs.jabref.org/collaborative-work/sqldatabase)  which I briefly described at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/2866#issuecomment-388264343:  - Multiple users should be supported  seamlessly  - If user A and B work on the bibfile  a modification by user A on a bibtex entry B1 should not trigger any  changes  dialog if user B did not do any changes. - A  Merge Entries  dialog should popup if users A and B modified the same entry.  How this works can be tried out using the [Shared SQL Database Feature](http://help.jabref.org/en/SQLDatabase) of JabRef  where @obraliar and me worked hard to  have a very nice user experience.  Technically  this is not that easy to achieve. However  users will be happy  if it  just works .  At each instance of JabRef:  - Local state L is known - Remote state R is known - In case an update is made remotely  the diff can be applied to R.   So R  is known. Based on R and R   the entries E where a change was made  are known.   Based on E  changes can be applied to L.   If in L the entry was not modified: just apply the update.   If in L the entry was modified: Start the merge entries dialog.  ## Implementation idea  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1366654/69493789-68e51580-0eb3-11ea-9da8-319a9ebfb246.png)  ## Current implementation state  TODO:  - Add tests (multi-threading: update file in parallel  ... !) - saved flag local in the update monitor - Work on work on BibdatabaseDiff only - Trigger the merge entries popup  Optional: - Instead of the merge entries dialog  the changes should be displayed - Add a button to the change display panel to open the merge entries dialog  because the merge entries dialog has a visual diff instead of a text-only description.  DONE:  - After a synchronization is triggered: the referenceFile is updated with the current database - Synchronize change detection and file writing: should not happen in parallel - Use !Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() instead of true in endless loop in thread  <!--  - All items with  [ ]  are still a TODO. - All items checked with  [x]  are done. - Remove items not applicable -->  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?
