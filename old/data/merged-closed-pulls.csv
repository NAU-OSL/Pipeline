The user can now specify an arbitrary number of file-link columns in te ""Entry table columns"" preferences tab, to be added to the main table. The user can any file types specified in the list of External File Types. The extra columns work exactly like the original file-link column.

For each file-link column whenever there are multiple files, the letter ""m"" is displayed at the bottom right corner of the icon.

XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.

Practically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. 

The deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by ""jabref/""), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.

If these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: 
https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/
can be closed.

I just upgraded to 2.10 and I found some bugs immediately.
1. in the right-click-menu there is no `move-to-group` but 2 `remove
from group` instead.
2. I like the new add/remove/move panel, but the scrolling is not
working, which is a big problem. Because I have lots of groups which
cannot even fit into the full screen height after expansion.
3. no way to expand or collapse all nodes

I tried the dev version, all problems still exist. Here is my fixation.

Cheers,

W.L.

The bug was caused by EntryEditorTabFocusListener accessing the unused inherited parent field

Instead of doing just a quick fix, I decided to eliminate the excessive code and data duplication
in the two classes altogether and consolidate them into one class (with an additional flag to the constructor),
since I don't think an extra class is warranted here (and easily and sensibly implementable by derivation).

Main changes are:
- Create a new target based on Oracle's appbundler to create a bundle compatible with newer JVMs. (not compatible with Apple's JVM).
- Move the older target to Jabref-legacy.app.
- Remove the old deprecated wrapper OSXAdapter, which does not work with Oracle's JVM.
- Create new wrapper based on com.apple.eawt (compatible with both JVMs).
- Improve the quit behaviour.
- Add support for the Fullscreen feature.

The code changes are compatible with both Oracle's JVMs and Apple legacy one, but the legacy bundle is currently broken as the code requires Java 1.7+. Tested with Apple's JVM (1.6.0_65) and Oracle's JVM (1.8.0_45).

All direct usages of `java.util.logging` are now replaced by usages of `commons.logging`.

This is not possible directly with `commons.logging` and requires the usage of the underlying logging API.

The major benefits are of this pull request are:
- All classes use the same mechanism for logging
- Many log messages have been checked and improved if possible
- It is now easier to switch out the internal logging implementation

Imho, we should either skip missing authors, or map them to unmapped commit emails.

Maybe @koppor can shed some light on this.

The idea is to use this file to replace our contributors list inside `About.html` automatically without losing contributor's information or being inconsistent between languages etc.
We may have to do some changes to the file structure, e.g. attribute _name_ only, but this PR is mainly for unifying our data first.

The script itself `scripts/generate-authors.sh` can either be included in the build process or executed manually at times, as it may be beneficial if we oversee the mapping process by a human.

Why?
- splash screen on modern systems is shown only for a very short period of time as JabRef starts fast
- we should focus on making JabRef to start as fast as possible. A splash screen reduces the time to start the software as additional code needs to be executed. 
- for each new version (even for beta and dev versions), we have to check in a png with 200KB file size into the repository. This increases the amount of storage required for the git repository by 200KB for each version/dev-version.
- The splash screen interferes with using JabRef via the CLI. 
- It reduces code in JabRef. Hence, less code needs to be maintained.

This is a PR that is open for discussion. Please add any pros/cons as you see fit.

4. Most license problems are caused by these classes.

> - **CurrentDate**: outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the current date and time in the format ""yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z"" (date, time and time zone). By giving a different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g. \format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd} will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30.
> - Default : takes a single argument, which serves as a default value. If the string to format is non-empty, it is output without changes. If it is empty, the default value is output. For instance, \format[Default(unknown)]{\year} will output the entry's year if set, and ""unknown"" if no year is set.
> 
> **DOIStrip**: strips any prefixes from the DOI string.

Should be automatically integrated as sensible default!

> **DOICheck** : provides the full url for a DOI link.

DOICheck as name makes no sense. Rename at least to DOILink.

> - FileLink(filetype) : if no argument is given, this formatter outputs the first external file link encoded in the field. To work, the formatter must be supplied with the contents of the ""file"" field.
>   This formatter takes the name of an external file type as an optional argument, specified in parentheses after the formatter name. For instance, \format[FileLink(pdf)]{\file} specifies pdf as an argument. When an argument is given, the formatter selects the first file link of the specified type. In the example, the path to the first PDF link will be output.
> - FirstPage : returns the first page from the ""pages"" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to ""345-360"" or ""345--360"", this formatter will return ""345"".
> - FormatChars : This formatter converts LaTeX character sequences their equicalent unicode characters and removes other LaTeX commands without handling them.
> - FormatPagesForHTML : replaces ""--"" with ""-"".
> - FormatPagesForXML : replaces ""--"" with an XML en-dash.
> - GetOpenOfficeType : returns the number used by the OpenOffice.org bibliography system (versions 1.x and 2.x) to denote the type of this entry.
> - HTMLChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\""{o}}) with their HTML representations, and translates LaTeX commands \emph, \textit, \textbf into HTML equivalents.
> - HTMLParagraphs : interprets two consecutive newlines (e.g. \n \n) as the beginning of a new paragraph and creates paragraph-html-tags accordingly.
> - IfPlural : outputs its first argument if the input field looks like an author list with two or more names, or its second argument otherwise. E.g. \format[IfPlural(Eds.,Ed.)]{\editor} will output ""Eds."" if there is more than one editor, and ""Ed."" if there is only one.
> - JournalAbbreviator : The given input text is abbreviated according to the journal abbreviation lists. If no abbreviation for input is found (e.g. not in list or already abbreviated), the input will be returned unmodified. For instance, when using \format[JournalAbbreviator]{\journal}, ""Physical Review - Letters"" gets ""Phys. Rev. Lett.""
> - LastPage : returns the last page from the ""pages"" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to ""345-360"" or ""345--360"", this formatter will return ""360"".
> - NoSpaceBetweenAbbreviations : LayoutFormatter that removes the space between abbreviated First names. Example: J. R. R. Tolkien becomes J.R.R. Tolkien.
> - NotFoundFormatter : Formatter used to signal that a formatter hasn't been found. This can be used for graceful degradation if a layout uses an undefined format.
> - Number : outputs the 1-based sequence number of the current entry in the current export. This formatter can be used to make a numbered list of entries. The sequence number depends on the current entry's place in the current sort order, not on the number of calls to this formatter.
> 
> **RemoveBrackets** : removes all curly brackets ""{"" or ""}"".

This just removes **all** brackets without checking for escape sequences or such, e.g. {.

> **RemoveBracketsAddComma**: removes all curly brackets ""{"" or ""}"". The closing curly bracket is replaced by a comma.

I don't see any use case where I want to do this.
- RemoveLatexCommands : removes LaTeX commands like \em, \textbf, etc. If used together with HTMLChars or XMLChars, this formatter should be called last.

> **RemoveTilde**: replaces the tilde character used in LaTeX as a non-breakable space by a regular space. Useful in combination with the NameFormatter discussed in the next section.
> 
> **RemoveWhitespace**: removes all whitespace characters.

Where would this make any sense?

> - Replace(regexp,replacewith) : does a regular expression replacement. To use this formatter, a two-part argument must be given. The parts are separated by a comma. To indicate the comma character, use an escape sequence: \,   The first part is the regular expression to search for. Remember that any commma character must be preceded by a backslash, and consequently a literal backslash must be written as a pair of backslashes. A description of Java regular expressions can be found at:  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html   The second part is the text to replace all matches with.
> 
> **RisAuthors** : to be documented.
> **RisKeywords** : to be documented.
> **RisMonth** : to be documented.

[Biblioscape](http://www.biblioscape.com/) formatter?

> - RTFChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\""{o}}) with their RTF representations, and translates LaTeX commands \emph, \textit, \textbf into RTF equivalents.
> - ToLowerCase : turns all characters into lower case.
> - ToUpperCase : turns all characters into upper case.
> - WrapContent : This formatter outputs the input value after adding a prefix and a postfix, as long as the input value is non-empty. If the input value is empty, an empty string is output (the prefix and postfix are not output in this case). The formatter requires an argument containing the prefix and postix separated by a comma. To include the comma character in either, use an escape sequence (\,).
> - WrapFileLinks : See below.
> - XMLChars : : replaces TeX-specific special
>       characters (e.g. {^a} or {\""{o}}) with their XML
>       representations.

The changes include:
- Search bar is now at the top
- Autocompletion suggestions are shown in a popup
- Search options are available via a drop-down list, this implements Feature Request #853
- ""Clear search"" button also clears search field, this implements Feature Request #601
- In incremental search mode: next result is selected by pressing enter (instead of Control + F as previously)
- Incremental search now uses the same search engine as the other search modes
- Added a new search mode (Live filter) which filters the table as soon as the search text is changed

I have a few questions:
- ~~There are quite a few changes from formatting the code in Eclipse. Is it ok if I include them?~~
- I have a problem with listening to changes in the textfield and programatically setting the text with setText(). The latter command triggers first an event for the deletion of the text and then another one for inserting the new one. Is there a way to be informed just once about such a change? (This occours in the following case: if the user accepts an autocompletion, then the text is changed via setText(). Thus, in incremental and live filter mode, two searches are performed.)
- ~~The SearchWorker implemented the AbstractWorker interface. As far as I understood, this enables one to do work asynchronously and then change the GUI later. However, the worker is simply run via 
      worker.getWorker().run();
      worker.getCallBack().update();
  In my understanding, this defeats completely the purpose of using the AbstractWorker. What is the right way to run it?~~
- ~~A general observation about the `SearchRule` class. Every method of it takes the query as an argument. I would propose to save the query internally in  `SearchRule` and thus simplify the interface a little bit.~~
- ~~The setting ""Autocomplete names"" is not yet implemented. In my opinion this can be completely removed.~~
- ~~The setting ""Select matches"" is not yet implemented since I do not understand the purpose of this setting. Should it control whatever the first match is selected after the search is performed? Moreover, I think it was not implemented in the old search pane.~~

Things which should be done at some point (I will open a ticket after this pull request was accepted):
- All the other inline autocompletions (in fields for example) should also use the new dropdown style autocompleter
- Search result table is not styled the same as main table, related [SF Bug 847](http://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/847/)

Comments so far? I thought it might be a better idea to get some input on the construction of the abstract class before I continue converting the rest.

The abstract class will work ""out of the box"" if there's just a single path to be set. In that case one will have to define the four methods in PushToTexmaker: name, icon, command line, and an init, primarily meant to get the preference key (maybe better to have a `getPreferenceKey()`? I was originally thinking that maybe more preference values could be read in here in case of a more complicated configuration dialogue.)

Since the default settings of Eclipse won't change in the near future (see [Eclipse bug 479928](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=479928)) and since it takes a few steps to configure Eclipse correctly, we try to create the required configurations
- warnings,
- formatter,
- cleanup,
- and save actions

automatically.

Following minor issues remain:
- [ ] When saving, Eclipse formats some lines. Not only the changed ones (as told) and not all (if configured to format all)
- [ ] On Windows, the inserted lines are separated by `LF` and not `CRLF` as the part generated by gradle in `org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs`. Works without issues in Eclipse, but causes difficulties in diffing with git.
- [ ] When regenerating the config, the content is simply appended and not replaced. The user has to run `gradlew eclipseClean` manually
- [ ] The `org.eclipse.jdt.core.pref` file is not sorted alphabetically: First come the gradle generated propreties and then our properties. This does not harm, but if a user changes a setting in eclipse. the file gets reordered. No drawbacks in the functionality, but hard to diff.

I propose to reformat the whole source code using the new formatter settings (solves the last issue) in the near future and to ask all committers to regenerate their Eclipse config with the new gradle target.

I tested the formatter with Eclipse Mars SR1 and JabRefPreferences. It looks good at first sight :smile_cat:

- [x] Remove debug output
- [x] ESC should leave the search and focus the currently selected entry
- [x] I pressed `CTRL+f` multiple times. The view changed (behavior due to old JabRef behavior, I would like to have that removed). 
- [x] Further, I cannot switch back from ""Filter"" to ""Float"". Have to restart JabRef. Steps: ""Float"" is activated. Search for a string where you can see the floated area. Switch to ""Filter"". OK. Switch back to ""Float"": Nothing happens. After a restart, float works as usual.
- [x] Preview is broken in combination with the new search. When switching from ""Float"" to ""Fitler"" and back: The preview panel constantly updates and the empty area above the entry grows and grows. However, this is a separate issue. --> fixed as this was a larger concurrency issue as a lot of code was NOT executed on the Swing EDT...
- [ ] Search is not aware of currently active groups. Hence, the displayed search results (found x matches) may be strange to the user when no entries are shown at all.
- [x] When the advanced search is active, the search icon on the left is marked red. 
- [x] CRITICAL Focus is lost from the search window sometimes as the entry editor can grab the focus in some cases. Fixed by removing the set focus upon changing the entry editor tab.

- Divided EntryTypes into subclasses BibtexEbtryTypes, IEEETranEntryTpes, BiblatexEntryTypes and introduced a new EntryType interface.

- BibtexTypes and IEEETranTypes required field checking is consistent now.
- Entry type 'Other' is not selectable anymore as it is no real entry type.
- Removed getUtilityFields method from EntryType
- Removed getRequiredFieldsForCustomization as its result is equal with getRequiredFields now
- Removed isVisibleAtNewEntryDialog, visibility is controlled via an internal List for each EntryTypes collection

We have a bit of a problem. `UTF8` came from these lines

``` java
        try (InputStreamReader reader = openFile(fileToOpen, suppliedEncoding, fallbackEncoding)) {
            BibtexParser bp = new BibtexParser(reader);

            ParserResult pr = bp.parse();
            pr.setEncoding(reader.getEncoding());
```

It is set in [this method call](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStreamReader.html#getEncoding--). That's the Java API. The `InputStreamReader` says that the proper name of the encoding is `UTF8`. 

My solution is an ugly compatibility hack in which we just insert the `-` manually. Ugly, but works... What do you think?

- [x] Please have a look at the `TODO` comments. These concern string concatenation and `@String` fields. For example in `parseRecognizesDateFieldWithConcatenation` the field `date = {1-4~} # nov` is parsed as `1-4~#nov#`. I wouldn't have expect the last sharp symbol.
- [x] Tests about JabRef's metadata (groups etc.) are still missing. Mostly, because I don't know the specifications :). Maybe in a new PR.
- [x] Related to the previous point, the `GUIGlobals.META_FLAG` flags should be moved to another place (they are not GUI, but parser/writer logic). What would be an appropriate new home for them?
- [x] There are 4 tests at the end of the file starting with `test`. These tests fail (without the `@Ignore` tag) but I'm not sure what they test and what would be the expected behavior in these cases.
- [x] There are quite a few ignored tests. These are related to open bugs in SF or are new bugs which I found while writing the tests (nothing big). I will open a new issue for the new bugs after this PR is merged.

For the record: While going through the code, I also changed the following things:
- Remove `BibtexParser.isRecognizedFormat` since the code has quite a few shortcomings (whitespace before @ or closing brackets on new lines were a problem) and the execution was quite slow for big files
- Fixed a bug where loading a file with corrupted bibtex entries showed an exception, cf. `parseIgnoresAndWarnsAboutCorruptedEntry()`
- Made `EntryType` an abstract class which implements the `Comparable` interface and overwrites `equals(Object other)`. Thus new expressions like `entry.getType() == BibtexEntryTypes.ARTICLE` return the expected result.

This PR is WIP in this direction and not complete yet. I will continue working on it.

To be able to write back an entry in the same fashion as it is read, we need to store it upon reading. I added a field to `BibtexEntry` for storing this and tried to modify `BibtexParser` to store the file content, but to no avail. The current code of that class is pure hell (uses a global `PushBackReader` to read the file in a very confusing way) and this PR is hopefully a step towards its replacement.

Instead of modifying the logic in `BibtexParser`, I extend it with additional methods that perform the new functionality on top. Current status:
1. On initialization the complete file is read into a `List<String>` of its lines before handing it over to the old parser.
2. After an entry has been parsed, the original represenation of the entry is looked up in the `List<String>` and stored in the entry. Blank lines following the entry belong to the entry.

~~That means we read the file twice, which is terrible for large files, but as this is WIP...~~

Next step will be to detect when an entry has been changed and the modification of the writing logic.

The handling of newlines currently is not consistent.

- [x] Cleanup python script
- [x] Localization keys no longer contain trailing/leading spaces and newlines. Tests are in place to ensure that this will never happen again. 
- [x] Localization keys do not use %e and %c for = or : anymore
- [x] Unit Test find ALL usages of of Localization.lang and Localization.menuTitle. Hence, the workaround to disable the formatter is no longer required.
- [x] If the unit test fails, on the console the appropriate measures are printed how to add the keys. 
- [x] Fixed a lot of other issues as well, e.g., when the exception message was part of the localization key. 
- [x] That all non-english property files have the same keys as the english property file is checked by the unit test. However, there is also gradle task/python script for this.
- [x] Unit test that checks that every english translation is equal to the key. 
- POSTPONE `<br>` is similar to `\n`, but for this we do not have checks yet as well.
- POSTPONE Rename `Localization.lang` to `Localization.message`
- [x] The KeyBindings use `Localization.lang` directly.
- [x] Refactored code of KeyBinding
- [x] update documentation
- [x] if any resource bundle is not available or if the given locale is not known or if the resource bundles have not bin initialized, always use ""en"" language. 

This is good for a review. The remaining points I would like to ignore as this is really annoying work, and this should be good enough with this PR already. 

New process:
1. Add new Localization.lang(""KEY"") to Java file.
2. Tests fail. In the test output a snippet is generated which must be added to the english translation file. There is also a snippet generated for the non-english files, but this is irrelevant.
3. Add snippet to english translation file
4. With `gradlew -b localization.gradle compareAndUpdateTranslationsWithEnglishTranslation` the ""KEY"" is added to the other translation files as well. 
5. Tests are green again.

Also, as the approximate string matching is based on edit distance (the number of edits required to turn one string into the other), it might be that one may operate the complete comparison on the full string rather than the word by word style as currently is used.

I think this is good to go (in the sense that it probably performs better than the previous), but please check it with a few different databases to make sure that the false positives or missing hits are to frequent.

Right now the entry type is converted from a string representation (in the bibtex file) to an EntryType by the parser. The problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode. The idea was to add an intermediate step:
String (in Bibtex file) -> EntryClass (by parser) -> EntryType (by some factory using information from the preferences)
- There is an enum `StandardEntryClass` holding all the standard types regardless of bibtex or biblatex (so article, mvbook, etc, all are there). To support also unknown entry types we have the class `NonStandardEntryClass`. So for example, parsing `@article{}` results in `class = StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE` while `@gibberish{}` yields `class = NonStandardEntryClass` with name `gibberish`. In this way the type information is stored in a relative convenient form (better then a string).

The idea of an enum implementing an interface was taken from the way java handles standard file locations. See [the oracle blog ](https://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/enums_and_mixins) (or [another blog](http://blog.pengyifan.com/how-to-extend-enum-in-java/)).
- The `EntryClass` does not know about required and optional fields. These information are provided by the `EntryTypeFactory`. For example, `entryTypeFactory(prefs).getTypeFor(StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE).getRequiredFields()` gives the required fields. 

Please ignore all the ""my"" prefixes in the class names.

        //              return false;
        // System.out.println(docin.getDocumentElement().getTagName());
```

is covered with the part 

``` java
if ((docin != null) && !docin.getDocumentElement().getTagName().contains(""Sources"")) {
            return false;
        }
```

because in the commented part, you check, wether there is an element ""b:Sources"". If not, then you check wether there is an element with sources. When you check wether there is an element,which contains ""Sources"", you have both in one. Also if there stands something before or after ""Sources"", then you go in the if part despite of what stands before or after ""Sources"". 
 So we deleted the commented part.

The motivation was to extract as much logic as possible from the cleanup action to make it easier to use cleanup operations also at different points (like on save).

Biggest changes:
- Move preferences controlling the cleanup process to own data class `CleanupPreset` and the execution of the cleanup process to `CleanupWorker`. Thus starting a cleanup process is reduced to setting up a proper preset and passing it to the worker.
- Move code displaying and changing a preset to a separate class. Hence it is now easy to show and change a preset at a different place (like in the preferences). 
- Move preferences code to `JabRefPreferences`. Well, this is the place where it belongs.
- Add tests for the `CleanupWorker`. More detailed tests of the different cleanup processes are still missing.

Todo's/Breaking changes: These are all related to the fact that there is no nice interface to get/set the file field of an entry (all the code is in the gui class FileListTableModel).
- The counting of unsuccessful renames does not work anymore (I vote for removing this completely)
- Remove CleanupUtil and incorperate the code in the respective cleanup classes. Currently this code relies on gui code (FileListTableModel) and thus cannot easily be moved to logic.
- Test the file related cleanups.

Switching to OpenJDK at CircleCI seemed to be easer in CircleCI than in TravisCI. Therefore, I switched in CircleCI.

In my opinion, this switch shouldn't affect anything as we do not rely to internal classes of the OracleJDK.

Side comment: Oracle offers a scanner for such internal usages: https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDK8/Java+Dependency+Analysis+Tool

Actually, as the tests reveal it was not a problem with the actual parser but within the file opening logic. 
I don't view this PR as a complete fix for #669 and #621 since not just the parser but also the serialization should be improved.

Also fix a bug that prevented the import of BibTex entries having only a key as its content.

Important point:
- Removed one file.exists check in FileUtil.java expandPath
  I think one check after replacing / and \ is enough, without checking the expanded path with directory in front.
- Cache is filled at initial creation for bibdatabase, therefore no checks against the whole database are done for each file entry
- Parse logic for file field should moved from the FileListTableModel to FileField.java.

We could still improve quite a lot here but maybe its GOOD ENOUGH :tm: for now.

It is possible to configure a `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter.Formatter` to be applied for the content of a specific field. All formatters in `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter` are available. 

To support file sharing, the save actions are configured in the meta data of a file as a comment, in the following syntax:

```
@comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:title;LowerCaseChanger;}
```

This above save action applies the LowerCaseChanger for the content of every title field on save.

In the future, we need to enable the configuration of save actions via the UI in the database properties.

Also add tests to the writer and parser (and do some refactorings to make test writing easier).

Changes (to serialization):
- Fix #621 and #669 by adding new lines after encoding and preamble. The idea is that everything is terminated by a new line and the parsed serialization only safes newlines which separate it from the previous entry. 
- Comments and preamble are serialized with capitalized first letter, i.e. `@Comment` instead of `@comment` and `@Preamble` instead of `@PREAMBLE`. This should follow the convention for entries.
- There is no space anymore between `@String` and the bracket and after the bracket, i.e. `@String{name = {string}}` instead of `@String { name = {string} }`
- Implemented [#756](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/756): Add possibility to reformat all entries on save (under Preferences, File)

Refactorings:
- Renamed FileActions to BibDatabaseWriter
- Merged code for export and save in BibDatabaseWriter
- Extracted SaveSettings class from FileActions to own file and extended it (& renamed to SavePreferences). Note that this class has some setters (against the recently established convention for preference classes) since there are quite a few cases where the values from the preferences have to be overriden. 
- Change usage of arrays to list in many places
- Remove unused boolean parameters checkSearch, checkGroup
- Moved writing of metadata and CustomEntryTypesManager to BibDatabaseWriter
- Extracted and reused gui code for displaying and editing sort preferences (SaveOrderConfigDisplay)

1. the save action feature itself
2. the look of the GUI

Regarding 1.: Currently, any class implementing `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter.Formatter` can be used as a save action and can be configured for a field of any non-null and non-empty name (so you can configure actions for your custom fields). That is quite flexible. It would be trivial to extend that to `net.sf.jabref.logic.cleanup.CleanupJob`. The problem with integrating cleanup actions is that a `CleanupJob` seems to represent a batch job of cleanups that are preconfigured for certain fields. It is generally not intended to execute a `CleanupJob` for a specific and selectable field. Hence, I am not sure if cleanups and save actions go well together. A downside of the current save action feature is that save actions cannot be undone (like the sorting feature).

Regarding 2.: The GUI is functional, _not_ pretty. 
![save actions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515701/13051416/6695bd6e-d3f9-11e5-83f7-9629616b3ede.png)
It has a check box to enable or disable all actions, a set of controls for adding a new action, a list for displaying actions, and a button for deleting a selected action. Do you have suggestions for a better set of controls?

Finally, the layout of the controls definitely needs improvement and for some reason the size of the controls increases when adding an action. These things need to be fixed. Alas, layouting is not my favourite task...

I would be grateful if someone takes a look at this and provides some feedback!

- All the UI related code from the GroupTreeNode class is moved to a new class GroupTreeNodeViewModel, which functions as an adapter from GroupTreeNode to Swing's TreeNode class.
- Add classes EntriesGroupChange and MoveGroupChange which store the changes made to the group. The corresponing UI classes UndoableChangeAssignment and UndoableMoveGroup now work as converter to Swing's AbstractUndoableEdit.
- Add TreeNode class which is more a less a (typed) copy of Swing's DefaultMutableTreeNode and which contains all the logic for traversing the group tree.
- Implement observer interface for changes in the group tree
- Some smaller refactorings like moving method from class A to B.
- Add tests for the logic classes GroupTreeNode and TreeNode

Since this PR makes quite some changes and there are no tests in place, I wouldn't merge this PR if a new version should be released the next day :smiley: . All the usual functions should work though.

According to https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/encryption/classification, JabRef can now only be exported ""to any end-user located or headquartered in a country listed in Supplement No. 3 to Part 740"", which is [AustriaAustraliaBelgiumBulgariaCanadaCyprusCzech RepublicEstoniaDenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIcelandIrelandItalyJapanLatviaLithuaniaLuxembourgMaltaNetherlandsNew ZealandNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandTurkeyUnited Kingdom](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/15/part-740/appendix-SupplementNo3).

The current code, however, also allows BouncyCastle to be removed and JabRef still compiles. It internally throw a NoClassDefFound Exception, which is handled properly.

I am unsure, how to proceed. [Debian also distributes bouncy-castle](https://packages.debian.org/de/sid/libbcprov-java).

When an undo with multiple entries is undone, each entry is undone one at a time. The Problem herein lies, that when the first entry is undone, the insertion in the database triggers the creation and insertion of an NamedCompund into the UndoManager which kills the main Undo (the one with the multiple entries), which result in just one entry being undone.

With this Workaround each entry has its own NamedCompund which solves the Problem but the user has to call the UndoAction several times (Ctrl-Z for each entry).

It shows that _none_ of the cases treated by the current AuthorsFormatterTest can be treated by AuthorList. Only two cases not being handled by AuthorsFormatter can be handled by AuthorList.

I identified three things what the AuthorsFormatter does:
1. It adds dots after Initials. Meaning: A L Some gets Some, A. L.
2. It separates initials: Meaning: AL Some gets Some, A. L.
3. It knows what initials are: Olsen Y.Y. gets Olsen, Y.Y. (and not Y.Y. Olsen)

There are significant changes in the APIs from jempbox and xmpbox. The current state of this PR is just a plain translation from jempbox to xmpbox to get the code to compile. The tests are not working yet, so there are probably some errors in the translation that need to be fixed. Also, travis seems to have problems with xmpbox.

Comments from anyone who is familiar with XMP handling are very welcome.

Search is now blazingly fast (compared to before)
- New class MainTableDataModel which holds all sorted and filtered lists plus sorting and filtering logic.
- If a search is still active while entering a new search term, the previous search is cancelled. This improves search time quite a lot.
- By filtering after the sorting, the search is extremely fast as the amount of sorting is reduced dramatically
- Using ""filter"" search should be now the fastest search, as no sorting has to take place

Issues
- [x] bugs using the float search (but filter works as expected)
- [x] remove sysout statement
- [x] tests fail as the mode of the database is written back directly to the file

Please try this out.

Benchmark                         Score     Error  Units
Benchmarks.parse                 49736.582 ± 788.879  ops/s
Benchmarks.write                0.706 ±   0.012  ops/s
Benchmarks.search                258.838 ±   5.604  ops/s
Benchmarks.inferBibDatabaseMode  1297.622 ±  22.910  ops/s

As one can see the parse operation is by many orders of magnitudes quicker then writing. I had a closer look at the write operation and it turned out that 66% of the time is spent in Database.getMode(). Some small changes improved the situation by a factor of 10
Benchmark                         Score      Error  Units
Benchmarks.parse                42031.971 ± 8188.833  ops/s
Benchmarks.write                 8.299 ±    0.304  ops/s
Benchmarks.search               248.093 ±    7.573  ops/s
Benchmarks.inferBibDatabaseMode  20759.711 ±  397.031  ops/s

I suspect the changes in #1100 improve the situation even more (since there the database mode is cached).

(By the way, `gradle jmh` runs the benchmarks. So its pretty simple to use.)

Still not 100% sure if this only applies to OpenJDK and GTK L&F or also to Oracle JDK and GTK L&F.
Metal L&F seems to work but looks ugly.

Idea is to try Metal on OpenJDK and wait if more bug reports pop up even for Oracle.
- [x] Maybe we should close at least one of the two bug reports that seem to be related to OpenJDK and GTK #393 #638 Or maybe even open a new one with possible solutions.

Also see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-8/+bug/1510009

**Especially see**
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813143

Maybe we can just ignore this and wait for it to be fixed in OpenJDK and add a hint to our FAQ and documentation?

Now with this PR

Benchmarks.parse                 46.965 ±   0.608  ops/s

Benchmarks.write                 85.171 ±   1.301  ops/s

For further improvements on should have a closer look at the formatter:
- RemoveLatexCommands for search (70% of time is spent there)
- FieldContentParser and LatexFieldFormatter for write (also >50%)

(also fixed a bug in the parse benchmark...this is why the numbers are so different than in my previous post)

This would occur when the second user save happened while the first user save was locking the database file or saving to the tmp file but prior to the copy of the tmp file to the database file. In this case the second user save would not yet see a modified timestamp or size change in the database file and thus start the save process. The save process would wait for the file lock to be removed then overwrite the database causing the changes from the previous save to be lost. This was especially noticeable when the database file resided on a network drive with frequent network latency issues.

- Removes comma as delimiter of author names (in NormalizenamesFormatter).
  The problem is that comma separated authors cannot be distingued from one author in BibTeX format.
  For example `Name, della, first` could be three names separated by commas or if interpreted as valid BibTeX string it is one author with lastname=name, jrpart=della, firstname=first.
- Add colon as delimiter of author names (in AuthorListParser).

Thanks at all, but especially @oscargus, for creating many tests. Made implementing this PR way easier!

This causes a lot of issues. I do not think that JabRef should still support such strange logic, and just use the value which is in the year field.

- Most uses are for checking null or empty Strings or similarly return an empty String if the input String is null, it may not be worth importing the library just for these two and better to create these two trivial methods in StringUtil (and use them to a larger extent)

This is confusing. See for example https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/742#issuecomment-209811934.

Currently, JabRef uses `info` for errors and warnings, too:

![grabbed_20160414-125653](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/14525943/6040e82e-0240-11e6-8916-1c1dda2da3d2.png)

The synchronized message is a debug message, which should not be shown in the general case.

To be consistent with the current logging approach, I changed the log level for a message from `info` to `debug`. This also reduces clutter in the log and on the console. 

The alternative is to rethink all log levels and the preferred default output.

Moreover, #1080 and #1153 are fixed.

In detail, the following things were changed:
- The abstract `ImportFormat` class is almost completely rewritten. Please have a look at this class. Almost all other changes are a direct consequence of the edits made to the ImportFormat class. The biggest change is that the import method returns a `ParserResult` instead of a list of entries (in this way, metadata can also be imported and error messages are communicated more effectively instead of throwing IOExceptions). Moreover, the import method operates on a reader instead of an input stream in order to reduce some common code in all importers.
-  Add method `importDatabase(Path file, Charset encoding)` to the importer interface which opens the file and passes the stream to the other import method.
- The BibTexImporter overwrites this new import method and uses the logic from `OpenDatabaseAction.loadDatabase` to determine the encoding of the bib file.
- Change OpenDatabaseAction to operate against the BibTex importer. 
- Remove get/set isCustomImporter: was not really used (just for sorting - now everything is alphabetical)
- Empty entries are no longer imported (thus a few test had to be changed)

Remark: The methods getExtension and getDescription are not implemented by almost any importer. This should be done. Maybe this is something for the stupro?

Now, replace is used instead of replaceAll so fewer backslashes and (theoretically) a bit faster.

I also added benchmarking for the following conversions:
- HTML to LaTeX (used at import, cleanup and save action)
- LaTeX to HTML (used for preview)
- LaTeX to Unicode (used for table rendering)
  and I got a slight improvement, although I cannot really tell why the two latter are faster now as they are based on cleaned versions... One reason might be that the tests are based on LaTeX symbols with more backslashes in them for the old case...

Before:
Benchmarks.htmlToLatexConversion      5533.070 ▒   86.148  ops/s
Benchmarks.latexToHTMLConversion     141500.226 ▒ 8011.038  ops/s
Benchmarks.latexToUnicodeConversion  124527.930 ▒ 3984.776  ops/s

After:
Benchmarks.htmlToLatexConversion     6153.450 ▒   114.716  ops/s
Benchmarks.latexToHTMLConversion     168037.040 ▒ 13412.341  ops/s
Benchmarks.latexToUnicodeConversion  173674.308 ▒  7455.006  ops/s

Here one can see that only searching the string to be converted once is far better than running replace on all possible characters. Which is not surprising, but require quite complicated code.

Finally, with the simpler strings it was easier to add most (all?) of the curly brackets required to solve #405 .

- Assert.assertEquals just works and no custom written assertEquals method has to be used

I clicked around a bit, but couldn't find any unexpected side effects due to the overwritten equals method.

Cleans up the `GUIGlobals` class and move `LatexFieldFormatter` to the `bibtex` package, which is now independent of the `gui` package.

As a final step, I would move the class `net.sf.jabref.importer.fileformat.FieldContentParser` to the `bibtex` package, which would make the package self-contained (apart from imports to the preferences and related classes) and would move the whole `bibtex` package into `logic`.

- `View changelog` points directly to the changelog specific to this version (eg. v3.3 would point to https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v3.3/CHANGELOG.md)

After changing the preferences the mainTable is using a new `SplitPane` object to divide table and `EntryEditor` - in the course of creating the actual table existing entryEditors are closed which causes a saving of the current `EntryEditor` height in the prefs. As this is calculated based on the (already new) `SplitPane` a wrong value ""1"" is stored.

To prevent this the previous state of the divider for the SplitPane is restored based on the prefs before the mainTable is recreated.

The current solution was surprisingly easy so far (despite what I had written before). It looks explicitly for our encoding prefix in the file (""Encoding: "") and kills lines that contain it (but only lines preceding an entry, it will not delete something that is inside an entry). Other user comments are left untouched and are _always_ written out again, even if the entry is reformatted.

User comments that are above meta data, bibtex strings, or the preamble will still be removed, though. Changing that would require large scale changes to these items in our model, since we would also need to store the parsed serialization for them, which we do not do so far.

This should receive significant automated, but also manual, testing, since it modifies a quite critical part and has the potential to destroy bib files. I will add a few more tests for this PR.

Some performance and memory improvements:
- Lazy initialization for journal abbreviations (reduces memory usage)
- Remove flickering of group tree updates by removing `groupTree.reload` (which apparently is not necessary)
- Remove group tree update on db changes since selection changes in the list view already trigger an group tree update and thus would result in two redrawings (admittedly, this is not very clean; but I don't understand why changes in the entry editor and cleanups result in ""selection changes""...).

A db with 6000 entries and a huge amount of groups was no problem with these improvements.
Build available under http://builds.jabref.org/improveGroupPerformance/

Results of further performance investigations:
- Conversion to lowercase of the field name in BibEntry.getField is the most expensive method for loading and showing a db (2 sek self-time for big db). Changing to TreeMap (with case-insensitive option) or Apache`s CaseInsensitiveMap resulted in no improvement. 
- Disabling `Show number of group hits` further improves perfomance.
- But the KeywordGroup match algorithm is pretty fast. The problem is that we run through the whole list of groups every time one entry changes; we could be smarter here. 
- Biggest performance hit for the group tree is now the actual rendering.

In the next release of JabRef we will introduce a revisid hotkey system. The 2 goals of this revision is to improve maneuverability through the keyboard and streamlining hotkeys. Some related hotkeys like for the side panes were scattered across the keyboard, so we grouped them together. You might be wondering what has changed, so have a look at them:
- Change default key bindings (have a look at the table below)
- Add a hotkey for creating a new technical report
- Add a hotkey for opening the OpenOffice/LibreOffice pane
- Add “Print preview” to the right-click menu
- Improve group pane maneuverability by making groups selectable by arrow keys 
- Improve main table maneuverability by making “TAB” jump to the next entry instead of the next cell, “SHIFT+TAB” selects the previous entry
- Resize the “change key bindings” dialog to 500x500

| Keys - new | Keys - old | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F7 | alt + f | Automatically set file links |
| F8 | ctrl + shift + F7 | Cleanup entries |
| alt + 1 | ctrl + shift + E | Focus entry table |
| alt + 2 | ctrl + F9 | Toggle entry/preview editor |
| alt + 3 | ctrl + shift + G | Toggle groups |
| alt + 4 | F5 | web search |
| alt + 0 | - | Open Openoffice/LibreOffice connection |
| ctrl + shift + F7 | ctrl + f4 | Synchronize file links |
| ctrl + shift R | - | Technical report |
| - | alt + P | Print entry preview |
| - | ctrl + alt + T | Hide/show toolbar |
| - | ctrl+P | Edit preamble |

As you can see we moved related functions together. “F7” is now affiliated with file links, hence we changed key bindings if they contained “F7” but weren’t related to file links.
Also we moved all side panes together by changing them to “ALT+(1,2,3,4,0)”. By doing so we hope to improve the accessibility, because now you don’t have to remember all kinds of key combinations for side panes, only which number stands for your desired pane. On a side note: Open OpenOffice/LibreOffice connection was added to this family due to being a side pane.
The hotkey for “Edit preamble” was changed due to normally being the hotkey to print.
The new hotkey for “New technical report” was requested by some users that use it frequently, so we added a key binding.
We removed the hotkey for “Hide/show toolbar” due to being not of any imaginable use for users.
We removed the hotkey for “Print entry preview” due to some conflicts with others and the fact that this function wasn’t really used that often by users. But we didn’t remove it completely, we added it to the right click menu.
We removed the hotkey for ""Edit preamble"" due to being a seldomly used action that doens't require a hotkey.
We resized the “change key bindings” dialog due to being too small for some descriptions.

For a big file (> 7000 entries, > 100 groups) the load time decreased by 1 sec from 4.8 seconds to 3.7. Half of the time needed for showing the groups tree is spent in calculating the number of hits. Moreover, subsequent rerendings of the groups tree (for example after changing an entry) are also quicker.

Note that the match algorithm changed slightly. For example, previously looking for `test` in `some$test` resulted in a match; this is no longer the case. However, normal word separators (like whitespace, comma and semicolon are recognized properly), i.e. searching for `test` in `some test` returns true.

Also fixed a NPE.

I propose the following class hierarchy for fetchers:

  - SearchBasedFetcher: based on a free-text query (may return multiple results)
  - IdBasedFetcher: based on an ID (single item as result)
- IdFetcher: looks for an ID (arXiv, DOI,...) based on an existing BibEntry

- Class position and name: `model.entry.FieldName`
- Constant naming scheme `AUTHOR_FIELD`
- Only use the constants when denoting the actual fields of an entry. Strings with the same content, but different purpose are not replaced (sometimes it is not obvious though).
- The constants are not used in `test`.

I do not expect to convert all fields in this PR, but I wanted some comments on it before continuing further.

This is a pure refactoring, no functional changes. It doesn't fix the dependencies on preferences, but separates them from the remaining classes in the root package.

Additionally, the class `JabRefPreferencesFilterDialog` is moved into the gui package, where it belongs. This also allows to rename the class and reduce its visibility.

Commits can be squashed on merge.

As described by @simonharrer at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1225#issuecomment-222481080 the components should be shown, get focused if shown but not focused and closed when shown and focused.
Done for:
- [x] GroupSelector
- [x] GeneralFetcher 
- [x] OpenOfficePanel

Bonus:
- [ ] EntryEditor/PreviewPanel

Update:
The panes extending the SidePaneComponent have implemented toggle functionality. To finish the task i depend on @mairdl 's PR: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1525 and his work on the group functionality. To make the toggle visible on the groupsSelector, the tree needs to be focusable and @mairdl is implementing it. Also the OOPanel depends on having a hotkey since the three phase toggling does not make sense when toggling using the mouse (you could click the panel right away instead of the menu item). So this PR will be on hold (hopefully) just for some days.

JabRef version
JabRef 3.5
windows 8.1 6.3 amd64 
Java 1.8.0_25

Steps to reproduce:
1. Select more than entry from [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) .
2. Select ""Send to File"" and then choose ""Medline"" Format.
3. Open Jabref and select ""Import into new database"".
4.  I get an IndexOutOfBoundException shown on the console and no entries are imported.

Alternatively use the testfiles I added in this PR.

Quick fix: Add an if clause around the substring method, that causes the Exception.

I managed in a few positions, but more importantly i reinstalled Find bugs as a consequence of this. 

I found a few quite bad bugs, such as NPEs when clicking ""Browse"" in the journal management dialog with an empty text field. Also, there where some other example of introducing requireNonNull without really checking that all existing calling functions did call without a null hard coded...

@Siedlerchr as I know that you are a big fan of Path, Find bugs complains that some method there is quite likely to return null (I think getPath()), so stacking a number of method calls is claimed to be risky.

Still a few to be fixed (appending a database with explicit groups will most likely not work at the moment), but I leave that to the persons introducing them.

There are some fundamental issues with drag and drop, such as the entry in the entry editor keeps changing when selecting other entries to drag. Also, I do not really get the table to update very nicely, even though the code is to a large extent a copy of the file link editor.

One can see this as a proof of concept and maybe something to build further upon. If it wasn't for the weird behaviour of the table, I would be more positive.

Ideally we should specify one or more fields that can be used to relate entries, such as ""cites"" and ""similar"" (or something).

In some classes implementing `Formatter`, `equals` and `hashCode` are overridden by `defaultEquals` and `defaultHashCode` but in most not. Not really clear how this really should be.

This is useful in generating a database from an aux file and for generating a database based on an OO/LO document. It could also be useful for generating a subdatabase from selected entries (or copying relevant strings when copying entries).

There are some problems though related to the preamble. In OO/LO the entries may come from several databases and there it is not obvious how to deal with the preamble. However, a possibly solvable problem is to detect which strings are used in the preamble.

In AuxParserTest @stefan-kolb have generated a test file with a string in the preamble. JabRef doesn't parse this in a way such that the string can be resolved automatically. Earlier, the preamble and all strings were copied in AuxParser, but I was hoping to only copy the relevant strings. Any input on how the preamble issue should be solved? One way would simply be to parse the preamble for strings, I guess. Any other suggestions?

As this is rather crucial it would be great if someone else checks what I have done ;-)

To explain: 

```
-                // get the text before the entry
-                String prolog = parsedSerialization.substring(0, parsedSerialization.lastIndexOf('@'));
```

... did not work properly if an `@` is used within an entry.

However, determining from the complete parsed serialization where the entry begins and what are comments before the entry is not so trivial. Thus, I added another attribute in the bibentry `commentsBeforeEntry` in which the serialized form of the comments stored in front of the entry is directly saved during parsing the entry.

If someone wants to find out more, add the following first in `main` or `start` in `JabRefMain`:

``` Java

then it is just to work with JabRef until an exception happens.

The most prominent issue solved was on saving where the UI is frozen during save, but not from the EDT. It is possible that some of the `AbstractWorker` issues are better to solve by running the complete `run` in the EDT thread, but somehow I guess one wants to avoid arbitrary processing there and this at least solves the problems.

The minimum quality is achieved: The new system is better then the old one.

Some issues remain, which i try to improve in this PR. Also thanks to @koppor for finding these and even providing a .gif.
## Focus of ""new database"" instead of entry.

Expectation: When I toggle something, the focus after toggling twice should be the same. This is not the case.
1. Click on first entry
2. Show web search (<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>)
3. Click on first entry
4. Hide web search (<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>)
5. Show web search (<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>)
6. Hide web search (<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>)
7. ""New database"" is focused instead of the first entry.

Sometimes, this happens after step 4, but not reproducable.
## Position in entry table

(updated)

The position in the entry table changes depended of the selected group.

Expected behavior: When I select the third entry, show the groups interface, hide the groups interface, press cursor up, the entry above the current entry should be shown.

Example:
1. open `complex.bib`
2. Select fourth entry **in** table
3. Press <kbd>cursor down</kbd>
4. Show groups interface (<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>)
5. Select a group ""StaticGroup""
6. Click on selected entry
7. Hide groups interface (<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>)
8. Press <kbd>cursor down</kbd>
9. Effect: first entry in table is selected.

It prints the number, the character as Unicode `\symbol{nnn}`, the resulting LaTeX symbol, and the LaTeX code, see the attached file. In this way, we can make sure that all symbols makes sense (some of the current one were incorrect). Also relates to #1761 which is not currently included.

I note two thing: 
1) using `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` did only work for accented characters. I had a version where I printed the Unicode character in the table, but that only rarely worked, although they appeared nicely in the .tex-file
2) Packages and fonts are a bit of a mystery. It may be that with a better font and maybe a few more packages, more symbols are shown.

I figured out that the problem is that the `KeyEvent` returns localized key texts so you can not use this to set the `KeyBindings`(the JabRef `KeyBindings` use English key texts). At the moment I only see two possibilities that do not end up in comparing tons of Strings to manually get the english localization. 

~~First would be to change the locale to English, so that the `KeyEvent` returns english key texts, but I don't know what I might break with that and if the rest of the localization will still work.~~

 ~~Second solution would be to change the `KeyBindings` so that they use `KeyCodes` instead of Strings. This would IMHO improve the `KeyBindings` system but it would mean a lot of changes in all the `KeyBinding` related code.~~

The FXML files may contain localized strings in the form `<label text = ""%localized description"">` (and not `Localization.lang(""localized description""`)). I adapted the LocalizationParser to also look for these kind of strings. Together with #1753, the JavaFX branch should now build without errors.

For some reason the ManageJournalAbbreviationsView has some problems with localized strings, although the same code works for the other dialogs. This needs further investigations (not part of this PR).

With this gradle task the keys in the Localization files get rearranged according to the English file. 
The top 3 comment lines of each file stay the same (some files have different encoding) but everything else (comments, blank lines) are getting synced with the English file.

The localization file are only sorted if they have no missing, obsolete, or duplicate keys.
A colored output is printed to inform the developer.

When this PR has passed I plan to refactor `syncLang.py`, code and output wise.

- [ ] Add hierarchical delimiter and change parsing logic in `KeywordList` accordingly -> new PR
- [ ] Change UI to support hierarchical keywords -> new PR

Note: I also moved the StringUtil class to model (in some sense it is JabRef's own String class) and removed EntryUtil (only had methods related to strings (-> StringUtil) or keywords (-> KeywordList) ).

@bartsch-dev had a great idea to use his `Version` class to get the changelog url since it already provides a method for it. I only adjusted it slightly so dev versions will be redirected to https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased. Links will also stay gighlighted after they have been visited.

As you can see the right hotkey for this function should be`CTRL + O`. Also, the word database gets translated as `Datei` instead of `Datenbank`.

This PR aims to fix this issue by rewording the translation. Every English occurrence of `database`is now translated as `Datenbank`. This is what it looks like now:

Rewrite the MODS exporter with a JAXB parser.

This PR uses the same gradle script and schema as in #1942 .

`FocusListener` was a simple class just executing `requestFocus()` at the end. It was removed.

`adjustSplitter` is executed within `showEditor`. Thus, these calls were removed, too.

As observed by @oscargus in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1876#issuecomment-247533268 certain mixed search queries does not work (for example, `fruity and keywords=apple`).
This PR fixes this issue.

Side-effect: simple queries as `fruity` are also recognized as ""grammar based"" (which is why I had to change a few tests). However, there should be no major performance decline since the query parsing is quite fast and for the actual search in the end the same code gets called.

In #1874 part of the StringUtil was already moved to the model package. With this PR the whole class is moved. I think it does not make sense to have two classes with the same purpose but different locations. 

The StringUtil class is rather big and we should consider splitting it or moving some parts of it to different classes.

To fix this bug I added the IdFetcher section to the BibLaTeX-mode, as it was intended. Before, it was only in the BibTeX mode. The problem was that the fetcherWorker was null in the BibLaTeX-mode, because `createIdFetcherPanel()` was only called in the `else` part. So the fetcherWorker was never initialized.
The ParameterizedDialogNewEntryTest works fine again.

I rewrote the the localization script:

The Script has following commands available
- `$ python scripts/syncLang.py status [--extended]`
  - prints the current status to the terminal
  - `[--extended]` if the translations keys which create problems should be printed
  - usable with Gradle tasks
    - `$ gradle status`
    - `$ gradle statusExtended`
- `$ python scripts/syncLang.py markdown`
  - Creates a markdown file of the current status and opens it
  - usable with Gradle tasks
    - `$ gradle statusWithMarkdown`
- `$ python scripts/syncLang.py update [--extended]`
  - compares all the localization files against the English one and fixes unambiguous duplicates, removes obsolete keys, adds missing keys, and sorts them
  - `[--extended]` if the translations keys which create problems should be printed
  - usable with Gradle tasks
    - `$ gradle update`
    - `$ gradle updateExtended`

Steps to reproduce the bug:
- Open two JabRef instances A and B
- Connect A and B to a shared database supporting LiveUpdate
- Create a new Entry in A
- Open the entry and change the value of a field like author
- Delete the new Entry from B and confirm the upcoming dialog in A

`MainTable` and `EntryMarker` contains a lot of ugly code which produces such errors and can be refactored. @bartsch-dev shows interest to do this probably in the next week. :+1:

This PR removes the ""content selectors"".
According to [our help page](http://help.jabref.org/en/ContentSelector), they are supposed ""to store a selection of often-used words or phrases that you use often in your database"". But exactly the same functionality is already there with the autocompletion. Thus I don't see any advantage of having the content selectors. 

I did some background check and was not able to find a single bib file in the web which uses the content selectors. Moreover, the most discussions about them were from around 2004. The only feature request related to content selectors is the still open https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/669/ which requests to store certain phrases that are often used in reviews. 
I kind of see the use case there, but if this feature is really wished I would opt for a review template.
To be honest, I doubt that anybody even understood how to add phrases in the ""Manage content selector"" dialog, not to mention that probably nobody looked under ""content selectors"" for such a feature. 

@JabRef/developers do you know of a good use case for this feature??

With this fix at least getting the first 10 search hits is possible again. 

Configuration is no longer possible in the current form and google generally limits the responses (per page) to 20 hits (however, even using this will cause a captcha challenge for JabRef).

As only 10 hits are allowed a rewrite to the new FetcherInfrastructure should now be possible (thus, omitting the 2-step approach).

The German translation of JabRef has some issues, have a look at the following screenshot:

The function to open a database is called `Datei öffnen` the displayed hotkey is `F4`. In the English version of JabRef the file menu looks like this:

<img width=""246"" alt=""openfilemenu"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15333533/18558802/c54ec65c-7b74-11e6-8bd7-7147e851d0e8.png"">

As you can see the right hotkey for this function should be`CTRL + O`. Also, the word database gets translated as `Datei` instead of `Datenbank`.

This PR aims to fix this issue by rewording the translation. Every English occurrence of `database`is now translated as `Datenbank`. This is what it looks like now:

Only problem is that this annotation cannot be automatically generated by a gradle or ant script, that's why added the package-info.java to src/main/java/net/...../mods.

2102lenhard1515701closed2016-09-30T09:47:14Z2016-10-03T07:37:47ZStore LaTeX-free fields in BibEntry"Based on the discussion in #1993 and the work of @bartsch-dev in #2091, this PR aims to improve the speed of search by storing LaTeX-free versions of field values in a cache. It aims at a balance between better performance and an acceptable memory footprint. Basically, all ideas from #1993 are implemented: a cached store of LaTeX-free fields which is computed on demand, String internalization, and regex performance improvements in `LatexToUnicode`.

Here are measurements with the new branch:

```
Benchmark                             Mode  Cnt         Score        Error  Unit
Benchmarks.latexToUnicodeConversion  thrpt   20    119823.078   2063.425  ops/s
Benchmarks.parallelSearch            thrpt   20       735.890    113.685  ops/s
Benchmarks.search                    thrpt   20       397.807     28.557  ops/s
```

The memory footprint of a database with 6500 entries is ~ 912 MB on my machine

And on current master:

```
Benchmark                             Mode  Cnt         Score        Error  Unit
Benchmarks.latexToUnicodeConversion  thrpt   20     94367.718   2570.784  ops/s
Benchmarks.parallelSearch            thrpt   20        58.204       3.285  ops/s
Benchmarks.search                    thrpt   20        30.531       0.952  ops/s
```

The memory footprint of the same 6500 entry database is ~ 888 MB.

All in all, this looks like a hefty performance improvement at little memory cost.

In the sense of the PR mentioned above, I changed ""Recent files"" to ""Recent databases"". Since it only displays recently opened databases. 

This is the file menu after the changes:

As you can see it fits in with the rest of the menu. One could say change the file menu to the database menu, but I think keeping the file menu named as it is, is better because it stays consistent with other programms.

Furthermore the issue https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2095 seems to be related.

**Utility for local databases:**

This feature is event based and saves the database if activated on every user interaction. An intelligent `ExecutorService` and `workerQueue` are preventing a high load while saving. Furthermore all redundant save tasks will be rejected.

An event based `BackupManager` replaces the old time based backup system. This one is also using a 
`ExecutorService` to prevent high load issues.

**Utility for shared databases:**

For shared databases this feature actually synchronizes the local file which is associated with the shared database supporting LiveUpdate!

- have at least 2 entries in a database
- edit the lower one so that it matches the first one in every detail (creating a duplicate)
- now the upper one will be internally replaced with the lower one (and will be lost visually), both entries in the table are now one and the same

This is again caused by the `BibEntry#equals` method which doesn't recognize duplicates, maybe we have to do something about that?

The aim of this pull request is to integrate the BibSonomy Plugin from JabRef 2.11 into the actual JabRef master branch. You can run BibSonomy from the menubar (between `Tools` and `Options`), search for entries and fetch them. There are still parts in the code which has to be updated. Since 2.11 much has changed. For example the MetaData which I have to investigate.

This kept bugging me, so I invested some time in it. It integrates the changes from #1964 and turns the different special fields into enum values. The different classes composing special fields are now aligned to our architecture. The enum `SpecialField` has to go to `logic` as it involves quite some localization.

There are still some possible improvements based on this PR, in particular:
- Outsourcing localization from `SpecialField` so that this class can be moved into `model` (this is not necessarily needed, though)
- Rewriting `SpecialFieldsUtil`, which is already marked as deprecated.

To maintain a reasonable scope for this PR, these improvements should be done in separate new PRs. They should now also be much simpler based on the new structure.

# Integration of the recommendersystem Mr. DLib
## Reason for pull request

We from Mr. DLib would like to integrate a recommendation system into JabRef. We believe that both sides will benefit from this.
This pull request is the basis for further and deeper discussion of what is the right way to implement this feature.
## Changes made to JabRef

A new tab in the EntryEditor is added on the very right with a small MDL icon. A loading screen is shown in this tab while a Thread makes a request to the RESTful webservice of Mr. DLib. With the received response, a SAX parser parses the XML the response contains. Currently the html-code inside this XML is taken to display the six recommendations received from the server.
If you want to have a look how the XML delivered by the server please click the following link: https://api-dev.mr-dlib.org/v1/documents/gesis-smarth-0000003299/related_documents/
## Notes

Please note, that this is only an example recommendations, the server-structure for handling the request is in implementation. Once this done, the title of the selected Item represents the request and based on this MR DLib will respond with matching articles.

Please note, that the appearance is only a suggestion. We are open and pleased for further input.

Please note, that code style is up to change. If you have improvements, they are all welcome.

A bug i couldn't deal with is, that the new ""Related Articles"" tab I created is only called up to 5 times.  After that it don't get updated. It would be very helpful if someone could give me a hint where I have a mistake in my mental model of JabRef.

The alpha/beta Tag has to be appended after the version number with a prepended `-` (eg. `3.7-alpha`, `3.7.1-beta`).
I also suggest that the `dev` tag gets prepended by a `-` to make it easier to read (especially if its a pre-stable version (eg. `3.7-alpha-dev--snapshot...`)). Currently this isn't necessary but it is supported.

The versionchecker only suggest non-stable builds if the currently installed version is also not stable (that's why I need to grab all the available versions now).

However, just using `getLatexFreeField()` was not possible as the table is using `getFieldOrAlias`. Thus I introduced a new method `getFieldOrAliasLatexFree()` which is based on the previous implementation of `getFieldOrAlias()` using lambdas. This approach is used instead of formatting the `getFieldOrAlias()` result for performance reasons as the latex-free field values are cached in the `BibEntry`.

*Sidenote: If this approach is approved by you, the same should be applied to `BibDatabase.getResolvedFields()` which is used in `MainTableColumn.getColumnValue()` to show a latex-free version of the contents in the main table)*

We are using citeproc-java library in CitationStyleGenerator to generate previews, which itself is basically a wrapper around the javascript library citeproc-js.

This is fixed with this PR.

When digging deeper, it seems also other calls to `Localization.lang` should be replaced by `Localization.menuTitle`.

For other cases, like ""Copy_BibTeX_key_and_title"" (or ""Open Database""), some calls might get replaced. The RightClickMenu calls `lang` with that string, whereas JabReFrame calls `menuTitle`. I would opt for changing the call of RightClickMenu. Reason: When adding a new language, first the menu strings are translated, then the other strings. To offer a huge coverage of the translation, these translated strings should be used at so many places as possible.

- Number of users and sessions
- Dialogs opened (so far only the About dialog is tracked, as proof of concept)
- New database is opened, along with how many entries it contains
- All exceptions are automatically recorded
- A few user information (Country, OS, screen size, JabRef version, Java version)

If you give your ok, I will continue and implement the following:
- Track all dialogs
- Add ""opt-out"" preference

In https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1359, we decided to use google analytics for this, but as Microsoft already provided a nice interface for java, I went for this route.

This PR is to track the current state of the JavaFX branch. In my opinion it is ready to go!! 
Any ways, these dialogs should be tested again:
- [x] about dialog.
- [ ] key bindings dialog.
- [ ] journal abbreviations dialog.
- [x] error console.
- [ ] MathSciNet review tab.
- [x] File open/save
Please test these and just tick them here. Thanks.

Finally:
- [x] Integrate changelog
- [x] Decide if fxml and css file should be in resource or source folder
  - devcall decision: source folder
- [ ] Add architecture tests: 
    - logic and viewModel: no javafx except javafx.collections
    - view, viewModel and controller: no Globals and JabRefGUI, no direct FXDialogService

 - Using and managing threads directly is bad practice. Since Java 1.6, there is `ExecutorServices` for this.
 - Relying on thread priorities is highly JVM-dependent and not portable. It is quite pointless for us to do this.

This PR replaces the manual thread-handling with a second thread pool for all threads that were low-priority before. The main (only) difference to other JabRef threads is that low-priority threads sometimes run forever and need to be interrupted when JabRef should shut down. The new structure keeps this.

I think also the IdBasedFetcher like DOI can implement the `EntryBased` interface and thus can be made accessible to this update function. It that case, `FetchAndMergeWorker` may be replaced by the new `EntryFetchAndMergeWorker`. Something for a new PR through.

I moved the type one step down in the hierarchy to `Exception` which is still basic enough to cover every possible.

- Entry customization based on BibDatabaseMode
  - [x] working for custom entry types defined in bib DB
  - [x] storage is working for new customized entries (instead of creating three/four prefs Strings for each customized entry type in the form (""custom_type_1_name"", ""custom_type_1_REQ"", ...) two distinct pref nodes (one for BibTeX one for BibLaTeX) for customized entry types are used which simply use the custom type name as key and the string serialization as value (--> parsing can be reused))
  - [x] loading is working for newly created customized entries
  - [x] write prefs migration (is performed on first startup of new version, existing prefs will be put as new custom types for `defaultBibDatabaseMode`, old prefs are not deleted)
- enable testing with cleanup after test execution
  - [x] bibtex
  - [x] biblatex
- various bug fixes and improvements, e.g., #2318 #772 #366 #365 
  - [x] refactor/rewrite parts of `EntryCustomizationDialog` to improve performance (refs #2318)
  - [x] fixes #2261 (and also clearing of bibtexKeyPatterns using ""reset preferences"")
  - [x] #772: Deleting custom type, restoring customized default type from exported prefs, no multiple import of customized entry types
  - [x] #366: Check ""Resetting overridden default entry types does not work, sometimes even crashes"" - not reproducible in reworked state (ask @stefan-kolb whether still an issue) - related to #2318? --> caused by running through all entries in all open DBs
  - [x] If a customized type is declared in a file it will be tried to import the declarations - if a customType already exists, a warning should be shown that it will be overwritten
     - before this PR (no import of already existing customizations):

**Future tracking of SnapCraft at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3121**

---

This outlines how we could get into the app store of Ubuntu (https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/desktop/ and https://shop.canonical.com/index.php?cPath=19). The issue is that snap is only supported in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. <s>Thus, this PR fails. We have to interpret following gist https://gist.github.com/evandandrea/c754964bfdfb176844f26f605ebbb8db and try to adapt it.

It seems that the IRC channel is the only help out there. The gradle support is very new (see https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pull/912).

Is there some Linuxer out there who wants to take over?</s>

## Howto install and update

- `snap install jabref --edge --devmode`
- `snap refresh jabref --edge --devmode`

## Current state

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/JabRef/jabref.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/JabRef/jabref)

- Registered at https://build.snapcraft.io/user/koppor
- <s>Travis is used for building as currently only CircleCI 2.0 is supported for building and we use CircleCI 1.0 for building. A switch to CircleCI 2.0 is tested at branch [circleci20](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/tree/circleci20), but does currently not work and it does not seem to be easy to get it running</s>
- <s>build takes approx. 9:30min</s>
- build will take place at `master` branch only (currently `snapcraft` only) to avoid much too much development versions at Ubuntu.
 - [x] too long version strings (as we use) seem to be forbidden, we just use `4.0-dev`.
- [x] get initial `snapcraft.yaml` working
- [x] publish edge version to Ubuntu's snap repository: https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/dev/snaps/7999/
- [ ] publish stable version to Ubuntu's snap repository (https://uappexplorer.com/snaps) (currently no version visible) - has to be done manually
- [x] test at Ubuntu 16.04
- [x] <s>Get travis to work</s>
  - <s>Blocked by https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/proxy-errors-on-large-uploads/1228</s>

- [ ] <s>work on transfer to https://code.launchpad.net/~jabref/+snaps for allowing building on ubuntu instead of build on travis</s>
- [ ] gradle binary cannot be downloaded from http://build.snapcraft.io. See: https://github.com/canonical-websites/build.snapcraft.io/issues/918

## Steps after merging

- [ ] <s>adapt `travis.yml` to build snap only at the `master` branch (and not `snapcraft`).</s>

## Howto build locally

1. `docker run -it -v /d/git-repositories/jabref/jabref:/tmp/snap koppor/docker-snapcraft-java-de bash`

- Extract serialization of groups to `GroupSerializer` (previously every group decided about its own serialization via the `toString` method)
- Move a few things from model and logic to gui since they mostly contained ui-related stuff (e.g. GroupDesrciptions)

When using required fields only, this works perfectly. When in biblatex mode, JabRef does not display the value of `journal` in the required fields, because JabRef demands the field `journaltitle`. This is not only confusing for me, but also for other users: #2209.

I know that a clean solution is #521. This, however, won't happen this year.

I also know that a bibtex-to-biblatex converter and biblatex-to-bibtex converter is another solution. This, however, forces users to run these when copying and pasting between databases. This could be solved by running these converters silently when copying and pasting. When JabRef is used in parallel to other software (such as Notepad++), this does not help. I cannot force everyone to use JabRef. Thus, simply supporting `journal` in JabRef is the solution for me. 

The biblatex manual states:

> journal field (literal)
> An alias for journaltitle, provided for BibTeX compatibility. See § 2.2.2.

Thus, it is not deprecated, but an alias and should IMHO be considered as full alternative for `journaltitle`.

<s>I am aware that this patch makes it hard for users using full biblatex with `journaltitle` instead of `journal`. I am assuming that not much users are aware of the different modes of JabRef and that they switch back and forth for the same file or for the bibentries.</s>

We now show both `journaltitle` and `journal` if these fields exists in as required fields.

This whole discussion somehow refs https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/160

 * Minor improvement: Enhanced integrity checks testing for biblatex-only fields to be aware of more fields (e.g., `location`).
 * All fetchers return now bibtex. (Before: ArXiv and msbib created biblatex)

Sorry in advance for the long text.

We are researchers in software engineering that currently work on user interface (UI) bad coding practices. We are studying UI listeners, in particular listeners that manage several widgets, like the following listener extracted from JabRef:

```
public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) {
    Object source = evt.getSource();
    if (familyList.equals(source)) {
        String family = familyList.getSelectedValue();
        if (family != null) {
            familyField.setText(family);
        }
    } else if (sizeList.equals(source)) {
        String size = sizeList.getSelectedValue();
        if (size != null) {
            sizeField.setText(size);
        }
    } else if (styleList.equals(source)) {
        String style = styleList.getSelectedValue();
        if (style != null) {
            styleField.setText(style);
        }
    }
    updatePreview();
}
```

In such listeners, the source widget is identified using if/switch statements. Thanks to empirical studies we have indications that such a practice has a negative impact on the code quality. We call UI listeners that control three or more widgets, Blob Listeners (see this PDF document for more details: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01308625v2/document).

We identified in JabRef six instances of the Blob listener and for four of them we have a refactoring solution. This pull request (PR) removes these four Blob listeners by splitting them into atomic UI listeners (i.e. they manage a single widget). Each commit of this PR refers to one or two Blob listeners. We manually tested JabRef for any regression. The new code is less complex in terms of cyclomatic complexity (CC) and lines of code (LoC): the new code has -38 LoCs and -21 of CC on the refactored files (according to Sonar analyses).


Complementary to this PR, we have several questions for the JabRef's developers:

1/ Do you think that coding UI listeners that manage several widgets is a bad coding practice?


2/ Do you think that the threshold of three or more widgets per listener relevant for characterising a Blob listener?


3/ Do you think that the refactored code relevant to remove Blob listeners?


4/ Do you have any idea of the reason of the presence of Blob listeners in your code?
For example, lack of programming experience? Lack of anonymous functions (aka lambdas) in Java 7 (and previous JDKs)?


5/ We identified two Blob listener for which we do not have a refactoring solution:
https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/autocompleter/AutoCompleteListener.java#L70
https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/BasePanel.java#L1409
Do you have any idea if these listener have to and can be refactored?


6/ Do you have suggestions about other bad user interface coding practices? This can concern controllers, commands, GUIs, widgets, data bindings, GUI testing, etc.

Another step for #2290.
Only change in behavior is that all the categories are collapsed by default. The reason is that I have no idea how to cleanly implement ""expanded by default"". But in the end I actually think in this way the dialog is a bit more usuable as the user sees all the categories.

@koppor the localization tests fail, I think this issue resulted from the recent merge.

My issue is that is uses both ""XMP data"" and ""XMP-metadata"" for the same thing. I wanted to rename ""XMP-metadata"" to ""XMP data"", but ""XMP-metadata"" appears in JabRef much more often. Thus, I decided to keep ""XMP-metadata"" and just adapt two other strings to that writing.

When clicking on ""Get fulltext"" from the editor view, the autoSetLinks function should be performed only to the entry being edited.
Before this pr, the autoSetLinks function uses the selected entries, which can causes problems in different cases (See issue number #2391 for details).

## Issue
`JabRefPreferences.CUSTOM_TAB_NAME_num_` should be used to really determine the fields to check. This, however, is really a **huge** architectural rework.

It has to be checked, in following (seldom) situation:

- Field X is defined in JabRef's BiblatexEntryTypes
- Field X is added by the user to a general tab

JabRef now complains that X is Biblatex only.

## Further changes
 * ISBN and ISBN are now BibTeX fields, too.
   - Reason: Even though, both are not listed in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) and the [lncs style](ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/splncs03.bst), I see them so hard tied to a book and article, that I would add it. In the case of a DOI, JabRef (more or less) enforces it by offering that field in the ""General"" tab. Moreover, [it is part of plainnat.bst](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/52046/9075) and [natbib](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/natbib) is a popular package.
 * `FieldName.COMMENT` instead of `FieldName.COMMENTS` (affects OaiImporter only)
 * Preferences: Use FieldName constants at `setLanguageDependentDefaultValues()`

We had a short discussion during #2363 what would be more useful: HTML code or Text. I think, text is better.

When using ""Copy as Text"" offered by using the CSL library, following is the text reaching Nodepad++:

> 1.Garcia-Molina, H., Salem, K.: Sagas. In: Dayal, U. and Traiger, I.L. (eds.) SIGMOD’87: Proceedings of the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Management of Data 1987 Annual Conference. pp. 249–259 ACM Press (1987).

When using the results of this PR and using Copy as HTML:

> 1. Garcia-Molina, H., Salem, K.: Sagas. In: Dayal, U. and Traiger, I.L. (eds.) SIGMOD’87: Proceedings of the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Management of Data 1987 Annual Conference. pp. 249–259 ACM Press (1987).

Note the space after ""1."". Further, when copying the entry preview generated by JabRef's internal mechanism (and not CSL), plain text is also pasted into Notepad++ instead of HTML. Thus, this PR makes the behavior consistent. Further, with this PR, html entities are correctly converted to text. - I know that I could contact upstream and let CSL correctly create a text citation and then update JabRef to kick-off two conversons: HTML and Text using CSL. This, however, is IMHO more effort than ""just"" (more or less) correctly converting HTML to Text within JabRef.

Continuation of https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1438 (for some reason github didn't let me reopen it, thus a new PR).

The core functionality now works, that is:
- show groups tree
- filter entries when a group is selected
- show number of entries (well, not really ""core"" but works nonetheless)

I tested it with a big db and the performance was quite good. 
Of course, many features of the original dialog are still missing. But I think it is better to merge/rework the group pane peu à peu instead of a big un-reviewable PR. Also feedback about the design is welcome (this is just a proposal). [Builds are available](http://builds.jabref.org/groupsRework/) since I learned how to push to master 😄 .

In the [new entry dialog](http://help.jabref.org/en/BaseFrame#adding-a-new-entry), one can use the id fetcher ""Title"" to create a bib entry based on the title. It uses the functionality from the DOIFetcher.

Discussion: There is no [merge entries](https://help.jabref.org/en/MergeEntries) dialog shown. The title by the publisher is always used. I would say that this is OK as the title casing of the publisher should take precedence. If the user wants to overwrite it, he has to use the entry editor and paste the title again in the title field.

I ran into the `Worker` interface, which does really nothing but extend the `Runnable` interface. I fail to see the point in this additional level of indirection. The `Worker` interface is supposed to mark tasks that should not be executed on the EDT, but there is nothing in the interface to actually maintain that apart from a comment line. All code using the `Worker` depends on the object being a `Runnable`, the `Worker` aspect is basically ignored, as there is nothing to consider in the first place. 

Instead, there is class `AbstractWorker` which implements the `Worker` aka `Runnable` interface and actually does provide the support for executing the task off the EDT. `AbstractWorker` is the class that is actually used in most of the code and it works just as fine if you have it implement `Runnable` directly.

Therefore, in the spirit of science, I suggest to apply Occam's razor and to use the simplest solution (remove the additional indirection of `Worker`).

I have 500 bibtex entries, out of which 125 are journal articles. With the article bibtex type, there are a few issues:
- It happens that an article should actually have the inproceedings type, but Google Scholar generated it wrong, and it was not corrected and checked.
- That the known journal is misspelled. This is hard to detect manually.

As a solution, I propose to use an integrity check which displays all the articles which have journals that are not in the abbreviation repository. This has helped me to determine misspellings, wrongly classified articles, and improve the abbreviations list overall as well.

This integrity check would also advertise our journal abbreviation feature more, and encourage people to contribute to journal abbreviations lists. Maybe, we should really create a cloud based service for that?

# Old discussion
Attempts to fix  #2426.

Is not yet functional, since the issue goes somewhat deeper and affects LaTeX-encoding things in all MetaData, also groups. The problem is line 64 in MetaDataSerializer:
```
 stringBuilder.append(StringUtil.quote(dataItem, MetaData.SEPARATOR_STRING, MetaData.ESCAPE_CHARACTER)).append(MetaData.SEPARATOR_STRING);
```
For every MetaData item, all special characters are quoted, including the quoting symbol (`\`). Thus, if there is a `\` in the MetaData, it is quoted during serialization, resulting in `\\`, which is read as such and requoted on the next serialization, resulting in `\\\\` and so on. 

Unfortunately, unquoting the text during parsing and quoting it again during writing does not help, since a single `\` will simply be lost. E.g.: unquoting `\""U` would result in `""U`, which upon quoting anew would stay `""U`.

The same problem should occur for groups, if I am not mistaken.

I now have the following options to resolve the problem:
 1. Add special handling for content selectors to avoid quoting for them
 2. Change `StringUtil.quote` to avoid quoting the quoting char (`\`)
 3. Add another method in StringUtil that avoids quoting the quoting char and use it for MetaData in general.

I am afraid that changing `StringUtil.quote` has wider implications that I am not aware of., especially relating to groups Hence, there is a need for discussion.

The combinations `\'n` and `\\'{n}` are converted from LaTeX to different symbols in Unicode.

This was really hard to track down. It was not a problem in our conversion maps, but in `LatexToUnicode`. The ultimate reason is that this code is just an utter mess of hacks and I could only fix this by adding another ugly map on top of this heap.

We have already identified this class to cause performance issues and, as you can see here, it is very difficult to maintain. We should consider removing the functionality and rewriting it from scratch or (preferably) replace it with an external library. After all, converting a LaTeX string to Unicode seems sufficiently well-defined that there is some library for this out there.

This PR replaces our own PDF parser with [CERMINE](https://github.com/CeON/CERMINE).
In my tests, this library was able to extract (relatively) correct information from a wide variety of articles. It had some problems with books and thesises (what is the plural of a thesis?) through.
As far as I understand it, it uses neural networks that try to analyze the PDF on a structural level (e.g. the title is often placed rather prominently). More information can be found in a [paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10032-015-0249-8).
In summary:

Pros:
- Good detection level
- Works for a lot of different journals
- OpenSource and actively developed
- Provides facilities to extract bibliographic information from a citation string (i.e. plain text to BibEntry converter would be possible). Can be tested [online](http://adalab.icm.edu.pl/api/citation_parser.html?q=L.+Bolikowski%2C+N.+Houssos%2C+P.+Manghi%2C+J.+Schirrwagen%2C+%22Data+as+First-class+Citizens%2C%22+D-Lib+Magazine%2C+vol.+21%2C+no.+1%2F2%2C+2015.)
- Also extracts document structure (i.e. sections) and a list of referenced articles! See for [example](https://pub.phyks.me/paper_references_extractor/cermine_out/4945dbf177156d481f686f116b9fce5b.pdf.cermine.xml)

Cons:
- Has problems with books/thesis
- Increases the size of JabRef from around 40 mb to 70 mb.

A comparison of different metadata extract tools can be found in the [following blog post](https://known.phyks.me/2016/comparison-of-tools-to-fetch-references-for-scientific-papers), which ends with the following summary
> the machine learning based models (Cermine and Grobid) seems to give far better results than the simple approach taken by pdfextract, at the expense of being more difficult to build and run. Cermine gives a bunch of infos, too much in my opinion, and I think Grobid is given the most reusable and complete results.

I tried to include [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) but it appears to be [hard to use](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/59) and has some [problems on Windows (until recently?)](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/92).

The PR implements a new method in `BibEntry`: `getResolvedFieldOrAliasLatexFree` that builds upon our existing `LatexFree` methods and extends this functionality to resolved fields. This method can be reused in the UI parts of JabRef that should rather display a Unicode version of a field than a LaTeX version, such as the entry preview.

This repairs the apostrophe handling in the LaTeX to unicode conversion broken by #2464 and maintains the special handling of apostrophes in conjunction with the character 'n' that #2464 intended to fix. 

It increases complexity and reduces performance in the unicode conversion a tiny bit (through the additional checks that are now in there). Ultimately, the goal should be to replace the conversion with an external library.

So after you guys had your fun in Lugano (and harvested a big number of changed lines), I want to have my share too. Thus here I'm with a new groups-related PR.

Previously there was the option to automatically generate a bunch of groups. For example based on the keywords contained in a certain field. However, this process was a one-time thing, which means that once the groups were created they were not keep in sync with changes to the entries.
In this PR, I introduce the automatic groups as a new type of groups that based on a certain criteria automatically create subgroups and keep them synchronized with the changes.

The current implementation has a few caveats which I would like to address in a new PR:
- Automatic groups are not yet written to the bib file (and parsed).
- The update process only happens if you switch between databases and the groups tree is reinitialized. 
- The UI in the groups edit dialog is probably not the greatest...

Remark: Our architecture tests threw a NPE instead of a meaningful message in case of an issue. This is also fixed.

Synch should now work appropriately.

Few questions here @koppor and all others:

- [x] If keyword sync is enabled, there is the possibility that we have multiple `rank1, rank4` keywords.
Only the first one is synched with the special field. Was this always like this? Seems like a bug to me. 

- [x] If we change the preferences from write special fields to file to keyword synchronization the data gets lost. Did I introduce this or was this a bug?

Fix two unhandled exceptions:
- StringIndexOutOfBoundsException reported in the [forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/t/jabref-not-opening/476/3), easy fix by https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/compare/fixExcept?expand=1#diff-224c7e1325d710cbdcb0995525549d30R1492
- IllegalArgumentException #2571 Reason was that the writing code threw a IllegalArgumentException when the field content contains unbalanced braces (i.e. `title = {some text containing { }`). However, IllegalArgumentException is a runtime exception and so it was easy to miss that one should catch this exception properly. Fixed by introducing the checked exception InvalidFieldValueException. 
In the longer term, we should probably replace this check completely by the integrity checker.

Rest is a bit of (automatic) code reformat that my IntelliJ now performs for some reason on every commit...

Related to [#2604](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2604) and [#2589](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2589)

In the class BibtexKeyPatternUtil I've added cases for [title] and [camel] to try and make them conform to the [documentation](http://help.jabref.org/en/BibtexKeyPatterns).

@Siedlerchr was also working on this issue [here](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/2597). I found out that  
`CaseFormat.LOWER_CAMEL.to(CaseFormat.UPPER_CAMEL, entry.getField(FieldName.TITLE).orElse("""").replaceAll(""\\s+"", """"));`
didn't work because to be able to transform the title into upper_camel this way the title has to be in  lower_camel case initially, which is often not the case.

I've added some test cases and changed a few others to conform to the documentation. 
I still need to take a look at the failing tests.

The user can now specify an icon (and color) that is displayed next to the group's name. Moreover, a custom description text can be specified and will be shown on mouse-over.
Also the expanded status is now kept when switching between tabs.

- Desrciption: https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/489/ and https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/818/



Things to note:
- Icon + color + description + expanded status are not yet written to the bib file (I will implement this in forthcoming PR)
- The UI in the groups dialog is pretty horrible. For the icon and the color it is just a text field, so in the current state the user has to type in the utf code of the icon (in materials design font) and specify the color using hex values. I don't want to invest much time into the dialog since at some point it should be replaced by a javafx version anyway.

Serialize and parse:
- Icon (with customizable color) that is shown in the groups panel (implements a [feature request in the forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/t/assign-colors-to-groups/321)).
- Description text that is shown on mouse hover (implements old feature requests [489](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/489/) and [818](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/818/))
- ""automatic groups"" that automatically create subgroups based on a certain criteria (e.g. a subgroup for every author or keyword). Implements [91](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/91/), [398](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/398/) and [#1173](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1173).
- Expansion status [#1428](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1428)

While implementing these changes, I had to introduce a new ""StaticGroup"" label in the bib file that replaces the old ""ExplicitGroup"". The problem was that the old group with legacy bib references
````
ExplicitGroup:StaticGroup\;0\;1137631\;1233448\;1314293\;;
````
otherwise couldn't be distinguished from a new explicit group with icon and color:
 ````
StaticGroup:StaticGroup\;0\;expansion\;icon\;color\;description\;;
````
I think we really should switch to https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/232 at some point.

Previously, the conversion of the old groups format to the new one was performed after the database was completely loaded and displayed. Thus after every change during the conversion the groups panel and main table were redrawn, resulting in performance problems (in particular with larger db's). 
Now the conversion is done before the db is displayed (and thus nobody yet listens to the changes).

Adding a larger number of entries (e.g. after ""Web search"" or import) currently takes very long. This PR tries to remove some overhead: add `insertEntries` method that admits many entries as arguments so that events are only fired once (and not after every entry). 
The performance is better with these changes but still not good enough (importing something into a very huge db leads to JabRef not responding).

Moreover, instead of creating many threads for the computation of the ""hit number"" in the groups panel, a thread pool is used.

Related to https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/237
I'm working on adding tests for key patterns + key patterns in combination with modifiers.

I found out why the title_case and capitalize modifiers didn't work with shorttitle. It went wrong because before the modifier was applied the shorttitle was already a concatenated string, so the formatter would just see it as a single word.
For example if we have the title ""An Awesome Paper on JabRef"", it would first turn into ""AnAwesomePaper"", and then the modifier would turn it into ""Anawesomepaper"".

Sometimes the sorting is not always directly correct visible after sorting, This is somehow an update problem of the gui I think. When you switch db back and forth it's correctly there.

Additionally I changed the cleanup to use organize imports

At least for me, it works now without problems. @stefan-kolb @lynyus can you please also check it.

For the error console, I took the suggestion https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2667#issuecomment-288742546 by @matthiasgeiger. The freezing after a Swing message occurred since 
̀`LOGGER.warn(""No localized message exception message defined. Falling back to getMessage()."");`
lead to recursive calls (actually, Log4j has some logic to prevent deadlocks but these don't take effect since the original message is thrown in the Swing thread, while the above ""no localized messsage"" is posted in the JavaFX thread.). I simply changed it to log level ""debug"", which effectively hides it in most cases. As a positive side effect, the scroll issue mentioned in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2667#issuecomment-288714639 is also fixed.

Since @lynyus wants to implement a fulltext pdf search 😛, we need a proper way to display the results. In this PR a very plain PDF viewer is implemented. Most  #PDFs are displayed correctly, maybe with a few small glitches here and there. Basic features like scrolling, changing pages and zooming work. In addition, while being in ""live mode"" the linked document of the currently selected BibEntry is shown - this is very handy in a two-display setup since one can have JabRef's maintable on one screen and the always-current PDF on the second.

The automatic keywords group now supports hierarchical keywords.

Note: Bib files containing an automatic keyword from prior 4.0 tests can no longer be opened and the lines containing `AutomaticKeywordGroup` have to be deleted.

As a way out, I changed the tag for the groups tree from `groupstree` to `group` (`groups` was already used by previous version way back). Thus older versions completely ignore the group tree and no longer try to parse it, so no NPE is thrown. On the downside, however, the groups tree is deleted upon save in the older version. Still a bit better than a crashing Jabref in my opinion.

I struggled a bit to decide where to add the generation of keys, as they depend on the database. Finally, I have added it directly in the EntryTypeDialog, as I felt that [BasePanel](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/BasePanel.java).insertEntry() (line 1180) would have too many side-effects for manual inserting.
An alternative would be to write two insertEntry() methods in the BasePanel, one for normal inserts, and one with regeneration of keys.

Also I have deleted the IdBasedEntryFetcher.java, as it was not used anymore anywhere.

Single underscores that are not followed by `{` are not converted to unicode during the LaTeX to unicode conversion. This is not actually correct according to the rules of LaTeX, but seems to be an important exception required by our users.

This is achieved by the following:
 1. Replace all single underscores with `JABREFUNDERSCORE`
 2. Do the unicode conversion
 3. Replace `JABREFUNDERSCORE` with an underscore

TODO: We should find a better magic word instead of `JABREFUNDERSCORE`, because every character will be processed by latex2unicode and that costs performance. However, it should still be long and unique enough so that we avoid accidental conversions. Suggestions anyone?

With this PR, this is no longer the case. The only problem is that the formatting of meta data items is not parsed (and this would be a bigger thing), since so far we assumed full control over the meta data items. This version tries to keep formatting as far as possible, but does a few customizations (escaping `;` and adding newlines where appropriate). The result is that you can rename a `groupstree` meta data item and it will be kept and formatted in the very same way, also with a different name.

I would say this is good enough and we adapt it when someone has a use case or problem.

It seems that it is high time for this, since javafx classes are already being misused, as this PR uncovers. Thus, this currently fails the build. The misuses are:

 - org.jabref.logic.journals.Abbreviation uses javafx.beans.property.SimpleStringProperty
 - test/org.jabref.logic.l10n.LocalizationParser uses FXMLLoader/PlatformImpl

Although we might think about making exceptions for the beans and tests, I don't see why the Color class should be directly accessed in the gui.

This PR improves a few small things about the date parsing:
- There were a few places where dates were parsed, for example in `NormalizeDateFormatter`, `BibEntry` and in some importer. All these code snippets are now merged in a new `Date` class. This resulted in more robust code and slightly improved parsing performance.
- The `MonthUtil` class is now an enum with a few static helper methods.

I would like to offer my fix for the issue  2701: JabRef would find too many files when they are search with the [year]_[auth].* pattern. The reason seems to be a 'null' database passed to the BibtexKeyPatternUtil.makeLabel(BibEntry, String, Character, BibDatabase) method, and a null pointer exception is triggered. As a result, the '[auth]' part of the pattern was erased and ignored. With the suggested fix, JabRef uses the '[auth]' part of the pattern and finds just the files with the matching author, as expected. A relevant unit test was added; no other tests were broken.

Fixing issue  #2739: a check in the BibDatabaseContext.getFileDirectories(String, FileDirectoryPreferences) method is added (BibDatabaseContext.java:203) to make sure that ""dbPath.getParent()"" is not null before its toAbsolutePath() method is called. This fixes 'null pointer exception' when searching files for databases opened without explicit path, as in the CLI 'jabref bibliography.bib' command.

Asserts were added to make sure that dbPath.getParent() and other variables are not null before invoking methods.

So now that we have released the beta version, we can go back to the alpha state with this PR 😄.
I actually just wanted to have a look at the autocompletion and use some built-in JavaFX functionality for it. However, just changing the JTextarea's to their JavaFX equivalent wasn't possible since the editor components (additional buttons next to the text area) required JTextareas.
Thus, eating the foul egg (= Easter version of ""in den sauren Apfel beißen""), I started to migrate the whole entry editor to JavaFX. So far only the DOI component is re-implemented.

Points to notice:
- Using JavaFX bindings, there is no longer the need to manually update the entry after a changed happened. This should fix these nasty bugs that sometimes changes in the editor got lost when performing a different action. Moreover, the main table is instantly updated with the changes in the editor.
- I opted for a slightly different architecture. Previously, there were the text field and additional components. Now these are combined into one FieldEditor.
- As for the groups interface, I will continue slowly to reimplement the other field editors.
- The style is not that different from the Swing version. For the buttons, I only used images:

This PR aims to make @lenhard happy again by introducing huge architectural constraints on our tests: they are not allowed to work with the preferences class anymore. As a positive side-effect also @koppor will be happy about this as tests now can no longer accidentally change or reset your preferences.  

Changes in detail:
- Remove `JabRefPreferences.getInstance` or `Globals.prefs` by mocking away all preferences class (like `LayoutFormatterPreferences`)
- Refactor `KeyBindinings` and `JournalAbbreviations` so that these classes don't operate on the `JabRefPreferences` class anymore. This required to hide some methods of the preferences in a new interface 
`PreferencesService`.
- Create architectural tests for the tests

Another reimplementation of an editor to make JabRef usable again 😸, this time featuring the date editor. The new one uses the built-in JavaFX date picker and so `LGoodDatePicker` is no longer needed.
![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5037600/25298239/b19487e8-26f3-11e7-886c-43181503edee.png)
In the progress I discovered a quite hidden feature: when you double-clicked in a date field, then the current date was inserted. I removed this as I think nobody really knew about it in the first place and moreover it also takes 2 clicks to select the current date with the calendar popup.

There are still some layout problems (small width, additional empty line below it) that are probably a result of the mixed Swing and JavaFX stuff. Hopefully, this will be resolved more or less automatically if also the background tab pane is converted to JavaFX.

The file editor now looks like this:
![look](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5037600/25431532/4a5a30be-2a81-11e7-9b7b-bc7d1e43fe46.png)
Moreover, I changed the behavior slightly to reduce the amount of popuped dialogs:
- ""Add new file"" directly adds the linked file (and guesses the file type) instead of showing the ""edit linked file"" dialog
- ""Download from URL"" adds the download to the file list and showing a progress bar:
![filedownloadinprogress](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5037600/25431624/9963fc80-2a81-11e7-8685-1dec04b62b32.png)
- Files that are found by the ""Auto link"" feature are automatically added to the files list (but not serialized in the files field) and can be accepted (i.e. serialized) by clicking the accept button:
![fileautofound](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5037600/25431654/bf54b0a6-2a81-11e7-9bd5-0d9dc18e514a.png)

The code was ugly and is still not very nice (global dependencies everywhere). Maybe I will find the time later to refactor the code even more.
Some features are still missing (e.g. right-click menu).

At the moment I provide the following API:
  * Indexing
    - `PdfIndexer.createIndex(BibDatabase database)` Adds all PDF files linked to an entry in the database to new Lucene search index.
    - `PdfIndexer.addToIndex(BibEntry entry)` Adds all the pdf files linked to one entry in the database to an existing (or new) Lucene search index
    - `PdfIndexer.flushIndex()` Deletes all entries from the Lucene search index.
  * Searching
    - `PdfSearchersearch(String searchString, int maxHits)` Search for results matching a query in the Lucene search index.
    This returns an instance of  PdfSearchResults which has a `getSortedByScore()` method.

So please provide some feedback on this. If it is fine, we can have a look how to design a front-end for this.

This moves the `adsurl` field to the `url` field. The current ADS fetcher removes the field `adsurl`. The `adsurl` field is the only url given by the ADS database to *all* entry in the database. I think it is better to keep the url information rather than deleting it. It is more profitable when considering the copy command 'Edit - Copy BibTex key and link.'  (I have run `gradlew check` and there was no problem.)

and the source group is added as a child. 

In contrast, when the user hovers over the bottom or top part of a group, then a line is added that indicates that the source group is added at this point (i.e. between Test 1 and Test 2 in this picture)

Fixes #2843 and #2851.
This was a tricky bug: JavaFX creates empty dummy cells at the end of a list view. For some reason the list view for the linked files had an initial size of `1.7976931348623157E308` and, well, creating that many dummy cells takes a while (probably longer than the universe took to create humans) and eventually lead to a freeze of the JavaFX thread.
The fix was easy, just add `maxHeight=""100""` and be happy (finally, after trying to debug the problem for ages).

This PR improves the performance of the entry editor to a satisfactory level (switching between entries leads to a short flicker of the entry editor but no real delay). Things changed:
- Tab panel is converted to JavaFX
- Each tab is initialized only upon focus

Moreover, a bit of the code was refactored (e.g. the creation of the different tabs is extracted from the EntryEditor class to many smaller classes, one for each tab).

So the file was found once from the root directory, and again from it's directory.

The suggested change addresses this by not recursively searching with Files.find. I presume that it was not intended that search was recursive without `**`. This may be related to #2274.

This PR reenables the auto completion in the entry editor. It is more or less a complete rewrite of this feature using JavaFX techniques. Now a dropdown box shows the suggestions instead of the previously used inline overwrite.

Current status: the auto completion in the search bar does not work and the code needs further cleanup. However, in the entry editor it should be feature complete. It would be nice if you could test it and give early feedback. Thanks.

It seems that up to now all group related changes in the UI were not actually stored in the MetaData and lost on save. This PR resets the group-related information in the MetaData whenever something group-related changes.

Hopefully I found all positions where that may happen. If tested it manually, but someone else needs to do this, too!

It also seems that IntelliJ decided to remove trailing whitespaces in the Changelog when I added my entry...

The frequent events are due to the bidirectional binding which transfers every change directly into the BibEntry. If we want fewer events, the only solution will probably be to break the binding, which would be very disappointing for the JavaFX implementation. In my point of view the problem is not on the side of event creation. After all, every change should trigger an event and JavaFX triggers many changes. Imho, this should be fixed in how we react to events.

I also noticed the exception, but do not get a dialog. This seems to happen because of the save operation invoked by the backup.

A solution might be to do less backups, by:
 1. Doing backups only every X events and not for every event
 2. Ignoring FieldChangeEvents in the Backup
 3. Adding the size of the field change in the FieldChangeEvent class, so that you can ignore it if only 1 character changed.

This PR combines options 1. and 3., i.e.: The backup manager ignores events that are very minor and only does a backup if enough of them have happened (currently set to five).

What do you think?

Changes in the entry editor now mark the database as dirty. This are somewhat proactive: even only opening the entry editor will mark the database as changed. I'd say this isn't a problem. I'd rather have it do the marking than forget one.

Essentially, this adds another listener to the properties in the entry editor that propagates the change whenever the property changes. I haven't figured out how to do this for groups.

Uses the event bus feature. Now, the `BasePanel` simply registers as a listener to the event buses of its `BibDatabase` and `MetaData`. The listener sets the status of the panel to dirty whenever a change event occurs.

This is the first time that I can see any benefit in our event bus system :)

I've tested this manually in a running instance, but somebody else should please test too!

It fixes a bug that I've only noticed locally and discussed with @tobiasdiez in chat. There's no issue for it, but the fix comes directly here.

If you have save actions configured (say LatexToUnicode) and the backup triggers too early (say after 5 characters) then the BackupManager interrupts you if you add a longer command in the entry edior (say `\alpha`). With this PR, the BackupManager is no longer triggered every five characters, but only if there are changes of more than one character (a user pastes text into the entry editor) or if the user edits a different field than before. This seems way more reasonable to me and is as it has been before (only backups when a user changes the field, edits a group, etc.)

This PR improves the performance of the journal abbreviation loader/repository/parser and thus is a partial fix for https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2966.
Previously, loading and parsing the journal repository files took nearly 10 seconds and now almost nothing:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/28175332-3b59e1da-67f4-11e7-9560-f2a504205c0a.png)
Main boost came from using `equalsIgnoreCase` instead of using `equals(text.toLowerCase())` and changing `LinkedList` to `HashSet` as we don't care about the ordering.
I had to adopt two tests which relied on the sorting.

Moreover, only one copy of the list is now stored in memory opposed to the 1 + 4 maps previously (equates to 1/10 RAM consummation). In principle, this makes the journal auto completion slower but I couldn't notice any negative impact.

I just remembered that my initial motivation to convert the entry editor to JavaFX came from my desire to display the integrity check messages directly in the entry editor. This PR accomplishes exactly this.

The location and style of the tooltip is not perfect but as of now these things cannot be changed since they are hardcoded in `controlsfx` (will create a feature request).

What do you think, should this still merged before the beta3 release? In the end it is only a minor change and shouldn't break anything.

This is an atempt to fix the problem with entry editor focus as described in #3052. In detail, when `EntryEditor` opens up, it is not focused automatically. The desired behavior is to focus the first `Textfield` on any of the `EntryEditor`'s tabs.

The way the fix is implemented: when `EntryEditor` is opened, the `JFXPanel` in which is the `TabPane` of the `EntryEditor` is getting the focus, The focus is given implicitly to a focusTraversable node contained in the `JFXPanel`. The selection of the node seems to be ""random"" (even though consistent for a given tree of nodes). As far as I've tested it consistently focuses the first `Textfield` on any tab, which is the desired behavior. I make this pull requested as suggested in #3052 discussion by @Siedlerchr .

I should mention that I ran `gradle check` which results in ""6 tests failed"" in my setup but this was also the result when I ran the test before making any change.

The problem was that the source tab only stored changes on focus change and this did not happen when you just select a new entry in the main table.

The PR modifies an attribute in the `EntryEditor` (`movingToDifferentEntry`) and turns it into a `BooleanProperty` so that you can bind to it and react to changes.

EDIT: Also fixes a second (unreported) issue: Now the base panel is marked as dirty when you type something in the source tab.

EDIT 2: Fixes also  #3063

Now the Other fields tab is rebuilt whenever an other field is newly added or removed at the BibEntry. This is achieved with the event system and a new subtype of FieldChangedEvent.

The source tab did not properly unregister itself from the event bus. For some reason, I did not manage to get this working when the source tab takes care of deregistration. Therefore, I moved all event handling out of the source tab and into the entry editor.

Using jvisualvm, I can see that garbage collection works with this PR. Cycling through the main table with the entry editor open increases used RAM. When you force garbage collection, the used heap goes down to close to zero again, instead of staying at a higher plateau. See attached screenshot

![heap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515701/29381572-f60537f6-82c9-11e7-9ad9-20e6208ca648.png)

So this fixes the memory leak. The overall heap size doesn't go down, but that's a different issue.

I added new 'Filter All' and 'Filter None' buttons.  They can be clicked by the user to

This takes care of parts of #919. It takes the existing built-in journal lists and transforms them from text files into source code. We've found the abbreviation loading to be a performance problem. This should reduce this problem a little, because we replace file parsing with class loading and the reading of the lists can be optimized by the compiler. Changes are completely internal to the abbreviation code.

This doesn't check the lists for consistency, the other parts of #919. It just takes the existing lists and turn them into source code.

This doesn't need to be merged into 4.0, but can be included later.

EDIT: Turns out our built-in list has 15195. This is too large for a Java class and I am getting the error `Error:(8, 45) java: code too large` on compilation. So we need to think about this. We can leave the built-in list as a text file (no performance improvement) or distribute it into multiple source code files (seems rather brittle).

The reason for this is that Java tries to fit them in the available display space. Examples: #3130 #3117 #2941

This PR sets a minimum size for all TextAreas in the EntryEditor. The value of 70px is rather arbitrary and I'll be happy to get some thoughts if this is good or if more or less is desirable. With this minimum size all TextAreas are nicer to read, even in the cramped up General tab. The only ""problem"" is that you now need to scroll in the General tab most of the time. 

All in all I think this should definitly go into 4.0!

When you externally delete an entry that is opened in the entry editor and accept the change in the dialog in JabRef, then the entry editor closes. That way, it prevents you from editing an entry that does no longer exist.

On top of that, I found the the source tab isn't integrated in the undo framework at all, so I have added this as well. However, it doesn't work problem-free. It seems that the FX CodeArea consumes undo events as well. So when you hit undo in the sourcetab, the CodeArea does the undo and then the UndoManager tries to do it again and fails. It has no consequence, though, apart from an exception, the undo happens anyway.

Since this is an improvement (add undo to source tab again), I would like to merge this even if it's not perfect. I have zero time to dig deeper into these FX problems, and I assume that no one else will do it. So, we can just merge the current state.

V8 requires different JARs to be built as the V8 JARs are platform dependent. This is not easily possible and the [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/43459663/873282) has no answer directly applicable.

Open issues:

- [ ] Produce multiple fat jars
- [ ] Integration in install4j

Previously, we've created a new EntryEditor instance every time a new entry was selected. This PR avoids that. Instead of recreating a new entry editor, the existing one is reused and just all its contents, i.e. the tabs, are recreated. This doesn't help significantly and we still have the peaks when cycling through the main table with key pressed, but it's a step in the right direction. Here's an overview
![jabref](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515701/29995805-2524954c-8ff2-11e7-8e96-76e7e3b030c0.png)
The peaks are from cycling through the main table with down key pressed, but as we can see garbage collection still reduces the used heap massively.

The next step (in a new PR) would be to avoid a recreation of the tabs and to implement a proper lazy initialization of them, so that they only consume memory and processing power when they are actually visible.

I've tested it manually and hope that this doesn't add hidden bugs. After all, the tabs are still created anew so there shouldn't be update problems. Nevertheless, this should receive some manual testing from someone else before it is merged. Lastly, since the tabs are created anew there's now a visible effect when selecting a new entry: The new tabs sort of ""fly in"". I have no problems with that, but if others find that annoying then this PR should not yet be merged before for 4.0 or alternatively only when the tabs are not recreated.

2. or we can reused MetaData listener (as GroupUpdate is also part of Metadata).

This removes  LatexEditor support (""Push to LatexEditor"") in JabRef. 

As stated in #3199 the last update to LatexEditor was made in 2009 (see http://www.latexeditor.org/news.html ) and the software can be considered outdated.

I removed LatexEditor from the applications list in PushToApplications class. I deleted the PushToLatexEditor class since it is now unused.
gradlew check was successful.

I am new here (first pull request) and also still fairly new to Java, so any c&c would be greatly appreciated. Especially let me know if either the practice of commits or this request is not up-to-standard :)

_Why_
Based on https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3191#issuecomment-326902439 I added two tests concerning cross referencing. 


_What_
1. It is based on two dummy entries, where source is cross referencing target.

_Watchout_
- I was not able to clean code method `assertSourceCrossrefsTarget` further due to the `Optional<>` concept.
- I wrote a small TestDataBuilder `BibEntryBuild.` It is an inner class, because I am uncertain where to put it.
- I wrote an crossref.bib-encapsulating class `DatabaseFromFile` to keep test code readable. It is an inner class, because I did not find a similar wrapper nor did I know where to put it. Its construction uses a path to a file to be parsed to a database.  "1436491

For some reason, some unhandled exceptions are report multiple (meaning in the thousands) times in the Azure telemetry. Thus we regularly hit the daily cap and I get an annoying email. I tried to investigate, but couldn't reproduce the behavior and thus I'm not sure that these changes actually fix the problem. The only difference between logging in the FallbackExceptionHandler to other loggings of errors was the direct usage of `log4j` instead of the usual `LogFactory` approach. Thus I changed it to the later and hope for the best.

While touching the telemetry, I also added logging of the creation of new entries and the created entry type. This information might serve as a guide for a forthcoming improvement of the ""New entry..."" dialog (with sensible defaults and/or completely different approach depending on how users use it).

The offered PR implements functionality discussed in my ""File linking functionality update?"" proposal (http://discourse.jabref.org/t/file-linking-functionality-update/723). It is now possible to use bracketed expressions (like ""[bibtexkey]"" or ""[year]\_[auth]\_[firstpage]"") consistently in:

- BibTex key generator patterns;
- File search regular expressions (for automatic file linking);
- Import file name patterns;
- Import directory patterns.

To maintain consistent formatting, I have created a new BracketedExpressionExpander class which provides its main methods, 'expandBrackets()'. They essentially contain all bracket expansion functionality moved from BibtexKeyPatternUtil, and the BibtexKeyPatternUtil class now extends BracketedExpressionExpander, and uses its static methods. The BracketedExpressionExpander is also used in FileUtil and RegExpBasedFileFinder, avoiding the previous duplication of functionality in BibtexKeyPatternUtil.makeLabel(...) and RegExpBasedFileFinder.getFieldAndFormat(...) methods (both now use BracketedExpressionExpander.expandBrackets() for dealing with *all* aspects of bracket expansion in one place).

The bracketed expressions now can be used for Import File name patterns and Import File Directory patterns, providing consistent behavior of all ""pattern"" tabs in the JabRef ""Preferences"" dialogue; it is also possible to use underscores in the Import File and Directory patterns (e.g. ""[year]\_[auth]\_[pages]"") and to place Import destination directories deeper in the tree (e.g. ""by-author/[authIni1]/[auth]"" Directory Pattern now works as expected, creating ""by-author/P/Pezzotti/2013\_Pezzotti\_211301.pdf"" for the reference: Pezzotti, G. Raman spectroscopy of piezoelectrics Journal of Applied Physics, 2013, 113, 211301).

To retain functionality that was previously implemented by the '\entrytype' Layout pattern, a new bracketed expression ""[entrytype]"" was created and tested. It is suggested that Layout manager is used exclusively for describing layouts in citation lists, and bracketed expressions are used for describing file system and database entry patterns.

The functionality was tested under LinuxMint 18.1 and Ubuntu 16.04. Unfortunately, I could not test it on Windows hosts since I do not have any of them available for Java testing. I have put in provisions to deal with both '/' and '\' directory separators in Directory Patterns, but I would be grateful if someone checks them on a Windows system.

On Windows, the install4j launcher (JabRef.exe) actually can be used to start JabRef with command line options. By default no output is shown unless the `-console` parameter is specified. That option is handled by install4j but also passed to the underlying `jar`, where it screwed up our command line parser since it was not registered as an allowed option. This is fixed with this PR.
Upshot: `.\JabRef.exe -console -h` prints the command line usage help page (in comparison, the old way `java -jar JabRef.jar -h`). 

I'll update the [help](http://help.jabref.org/en/CommandLine) as soon as the PR is merged.

This PR implements `Native Messaging` so that JabRef is able to talk to Firefox and Chrome (or other browser) extensions https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1284. 

I tried around a lot with directly implementing native messaging using Java. It worked in principle but was really unstable (everything JabRef wrote in the command line made crashed Firefox). Thus, in the end, I went for a simple powershell script that handles the ""native messaging"" stuff and converts it to simple command line arguments. As a positive side effect, you can now specify Bibtex code for import directly as a command line argument.

I also took the opportunity to slightly improve the code concerning with the remote listener (the old version didn't allowed arguments with line breaks to be passed). 

The installation routine still needs to be automated and this is where I need help. @Siedlerchr @koppor could you please have a look at the following things:
-  Copy [jabref.json](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/nativeMessaging/buildres/jabref.json), [JabRef.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JabRef/jabref/nativeMessaging/buildres/JabRef.bat) and [JabRef.ps1](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/nativeMessaging/buildres/JabRef.ps1) to the same directory as `JabRef.exe`.
- Make sure that the correct file name of the JabRef `.jar` file is specified in `JabRef.ps1` under `$jabRefJarFileName`.
- Run `REG ADD ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\org.jabref.jabref"" /ve /d ""C:\path\to\jabref.json"" /f` from the console (with the correct path to the `jabref.json` file).

Things that may be improved in the future:

- [ ] [Breakaway from Firefox process group](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#Closing_the_native_app) (otherwise closing Firefox automatically closes JabRef if native messaging was used to open JabRef)
- [ ] Implement things that are special to [Chrome](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#Chrome_incompatibilities) and [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/native-messaging)

The implementation in this PR is based on this blog post:

By now you find similar solutions in several Java applications. I'm not aware of a more convenient way to manually set WM_CLASS.

I tested the change on a Linux system running GNOME 3 and also on macOS to rule out any cross-platform issues. Also I chose the WM_CLASS name that matches the StartupWMClass in [buildres/snapcraft/jabref.desktop](../blob/master/buildres/snapcraft/jabref.desktop), so no changes are necessary in there.

I found the repo [Java FX hates Linux](https://github.com/woky/javafx-hates-linux) helpful which made a comparison for different settings for the *prism rendering engine*.

That being said, I found simply setting

``` java
System.setProperty(""prism.text"", ""t2k"");
System.setProperty(""prism.lcdtext"", ""true"");
```
provides the best font rendering without having to make changes in css that might affect other systems.

This pull-request adds a checkbox under Settings -> Appearance -> Look and Feel to turn this on after a restart. I incorporated it into the preference framework. On Linux, it is turned on in the default settings.

This PR aims to fix #3292 by removing the refresh button completely and monitoring the pdf files automatically for changes. In the progress of the implementation a few refactorings were made:

- Extract the file monitoring functionality from `FileUpdateMonitor` to a new class and convert the timestamp-based method to the new nio watcher interface.
- Extract the conflict handling code by external bib file changes from the base panel to a new class `DatabaseChangeMonitor`, where also some of the old code from `FileUpdateMonitor` now finds a new home. This class is still a bit ugly but in my opinion better than before. I hope that the conflict handling still works as expected. I tested it but might have missed some special cases/configurations.

To provide a reasonable implementation and not only a bugfix I had to change the layout. These things bothered me the most:

- `LocalizationBundle` and `Localization` were calling each other. We needed `Localization` to create the keys in the bundle and on the other hand, the `LocalizationBundle` was only used in the `Localization` class
- `Localization` seemed like a quick fix to provide messages as bundle to Java FX
- On each call to any function in these classes, the unescaping of messages was done again. This, in particular, was the reason why showed up as hot spot in the profiler

To unify the implementation, I based the complete `Localization` framework on two instances (menus and messages) of `LocalizationBundle` and made this an internal class as it should not be used without it. The bundles are (re)created when `setLanguage` is called and contain the unescaped keys and messages for the specified language as a fast hash table.

This enables two things: (1) We can pass the `LocalizationBundle` instance directly to Java FX with `getMessages` and since we only pass the reference to the hash table, it will be instantaneous. (2) Every call to `lang` or `menuTitle` is a simple lookup in the hash table and a replacement of possible parameters in the string.

The public API for `Localization`, meaning `lang`, `menuTitle`, `getMessages` and `setLanguage` did not change and works as expected. During profiling/debugging I noticed, however, that there is a flaw in the JabRef startup. The language is set after the initialization of the preferences. At least one preference setting uses a localized string in a static field. Since when uninitialized, the `Localization` reverts back to ""en"", these strings will never be in the user language (see [this issue](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3326)). Furthermore, due to this access, the `Localization` framework will always be initialized several times. Once in the init of the preferences and once further down in `main`.

This can only be fixed by pushing `setLanguage` to the initialization of the preferences which I did. One additional minor thing was that one message key was used escaped and had to be unescaped. Other than that, this implementation worked out of the box and passed all existing localization tests.

I commented my code heavily and would be glad if someone would review it. Don't forget that I'm looking only about 5 days on the code base and it is very likely I have overlooked something."3101638556

3331halirutan511683closed2017-10-21T05:13:54Z2017-10-21T20:30:44ZInitializing EntryEditor Tabs on focus"This is a very small fix with big implications for performance and memory. The reasoning is simple: Currently, all editor tabs (extending from `FieldsEditorTab`) are initialized when a new entry is selected. So even if the user is only browsing through the entry table with the editor open, on each new BibEntry we create all the tabs for each entry from scratch. This can in the case of `FieldsEditorTab` simply prevented by moving this initialization to `initialize` which is called when the tab gets focus. This PR addresses this issue.

I want to give a detailed analysis because there is much more potential when we slightly rework how the `EntryEditor` and its tabs work. First of all, this is the memory increase when I scroll the 209 entry example `jabref-authors.bib` with the current master branch.

![img](http://i.imgur.com/tt99OZf.png)

In the middle I start after running the GC with about 140MB and after scrolling the list, I ended up with 1.9GB. 99% of this comes directly from the `EntryEditor`. After the patch I propose, the memory situation is vastly improved

![img](http://i.imgur.com/AhRSD0E.png)

We need less than 400MB at the peaks and the GC seems to be able to do a much better job. It's not only an improvement in memory, but the performance increases dramatically.

## Where to go from here?

These things should be fixed in a next step:

1. `org.jabref.gui.entryeditor.EntryEditor#addTabs` is the major hotspot now because it recreates all tabs on a new entry.
2. ensure that all tabs get this late initialization on focus.
3. tabs should not be recreated at all, they should be kept as objects in `EntryEditor` and only get notified when a new entry is selected.

Unfortunately, I don't see that I can do this on my own without breaking some of the various information flows on updates in the tabs (esp. the source tab). But if someone started to work on this I would join. These are the things I would change first:

1. almost all tabs get `frame, panel, entryType, this, entry` on construction. This needs to go away. `EntryEditor` is an instance of `EntryContainer` and tabs can get the current entry. We need similar things for the other parameters. In essences, it should be `new EntryEditorTab(entryEditorInstance)`.
2. On `initialize` the tab should check if it is initialized and if the entry has changed
3. The entryEditor has a list of *all* tabs that are created on construction and it only notifies them on entry change.

### The ""sliding tab problem""

Especially with this faster version, the problem of the tabs sliding in from the left on recreation becomes more visible. I have no simple solution to this especially since I'm not sure how many tabs there theoretically can be. It's these line in `addTabs`

```
        // General fields from preferences
        EntryEditorTabList tabList = Globals.prefs.getEntryEditorTabList();
        for (int i = 0; i < tabList.getTabCount(); i++) {
            FieldsEditorTab newFieldsEditorTab = new FieldsEditorTab(frame, panel, tabList.getTabFields(i), this, false,
                    false, entry);
            newFieldsEditorTab.setText(tabList.getTabName(i));
            tabs.add(newFieldsEditorTab);
        }
```

If we have a reasonable number of tabs, the best and clearest solution would be to just disable the ones that should not be shown. This will give a fixed EntryEditor layout that works nice, but I'm not sure it would piss user of if they have to endure disabled tabs.

The second solution would be to maintain a list of all tabs and one with the currently visible tabs (`tabbed.getTabs()`). This will again lead to a wiggling tabs header, but not as bad as before. On entry change, we just modify `tabbed` to display correct tabs.

The third solution would be to simply close tabs programmatically but that interferes with the current `TabClosingPolicy.UNAVAILABLE`"407422

These constant notifications whether a PR-build was successful or not are getting on my nerves. Is it just me? I think we are active enough on github to quickly recognize a failing build, and we merge only passing builds in the first place.

Not to let @halirutan and @lenhard have all the fun, I'll jump onto the ""improve-the-entry-editor""-train. So this PR is a natural continuation of https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3331. 

Changes:
- The entry editor tabs are only initialized once and then later notified about getting the focus or the change of entry.
- The different tabs no longer rely on the JabRefFrame and BasePanel (finally!)
- I removed some commented-out code in the FieldsEditorTab, that was a relic of previous (incomplete) refactorings.
- Disable tab animation.

I reported this in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3335 and @tobiasdiez provided me with the hint how this could work. Against his suggestion to not overshoot, I decided to prove my point that even those small context menus have a significant impact because things will sum up in the end and those menus are newly instantiated for every visible field in the editor.

The starting point was the current master-branch and profiling it by going through only 50 bib-entries. This means that the context menus are instantiated for the visible text fields. This has an impact on performance and memory and, unfortunately, it is not only a tiny fraction. 

## Memory

Notable are the columns ""Objects"", which are all objects that are created by this method and underlying sub calls and the overall ""Size"".

![mem1](http://i.imgur.com/pjBJSlF.png)

With almost 40% of the overall memory size, it's definitely something to look into.

## Performance

The performance is with 8% not so large but still noticeable. 

![perf1](http://i.imgur.com/STSGgNj.png)

## Fixing it

By using the `Supplier` interface, we can move the instantiation to the point where the user actually right-clicks into the field. I debugged this, and it seems to work nice. The outcome was as expected. Since no one actually triggers the context menu by just browsing through the list, it vanished altogether. Here is the used memory with this PR created by exactly scrolling through the 50 entries. First the memory footprint

and here the performance impact

![perf2](http://i.imgur.com/HgJNhLl.png)

In conclusion, this means as long as the user doesn't need a context menu, we have no memory or performance impact at all.

## Note

I updated the `checkstyle` version in the Gradle built. I like to write comments, and now it doesn't prevent me any longer from using `{@link ...}` in doc-comments to classes that are otherwise not used.

This PR refactors the collab package and splits it into gui and logic parts. More precisely, the code that was used to determine the differences between two databases now resides in logic, while the rest went to the gui package (one might try to extract even more code to logic but this is a first good start in my opinion). 

I tried to not change the functionality. This of course means that I tried not to introduce bugs (although I'm sure there will be small glitches) but it also implies that I didn't improved the code too much. If somebody has time, he or she is really invited to have a look at the feature. Many things are not yet implemented (e.g. a real metadata difference) and the ui is just ugly. 

However, there is one thing which did changed: previously it was a kind of 3-way merge between the last saved version, the current state and the external changes to the bib file. However, the current state was taken into account only sometimes (and sometimes in the wrong way). Thus I removed this part completely and moved to a 2-way merge between the last saved version and the external changes. In rare cases, this might lead to an unnecessary notification of external changes (namely exactly when the external changes coincide with what the user changed since the last save). 

If you merge, it probably preferable to not smash the commits.

In https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3352#issuecomment-339910785, @lenhard suggested to update the entry as soon as the source code is changed (instead of only on focus lost). This is accomplished in this PR. 
Jörg mentioned that the most direct solution does not work since
> the store operation will move the cursor to the end of the source tab.

This problem is circumvented by implementing a proper bidirectional binding between the entry and the source code, which prevents update cycles.

Moreover, in case of a parse error, the message is no longer shown in a dialog but inline as a notification:

This should fix (most) IndexOutOfBounds exceptions in the entry editor. The problem is that the source code editor cannot handle updates when it is hidden. (In particular, there is no problem with the bindings etc....it is just a bug in the library we use; for normal text fields there is absolutely no problem in having an active binding while the control is hidden). In order to circumvent this problem, the source tab now removes the code editor as soon as it looses focus.

So here is now a real fix of these problems in the source editor (index out of bounds, paste, select all, update,...). The problem was that updates to the editor were not performed on the javafx thread although they were wraped in a `runInJavaFXThread` call. The reason was that this method would actually submit tasks to the executor, which would then start a new thread. So the fix only happens in `DefaultTaskExecutor`, the rest of the changes are minor cosmetic improvements to get rid of globals or base panels in the source tab.

This PR adds a simple GUI test for the source editor, which I used to track down the index of out bounds exception. It uses [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX), which seems to be a good framework for javafx gui tests. For example, it is possible to run the unit tests in a headless method - thus allowing it to run on travis. For me, the biggest advantage is that you can isolate different parts of the system (i.e. only add the source tab) and ignore the rest of the application. Thus you can write ""unit tests for ui"".

Disclaimer: I will not invest any more work in these gui tests. But since some of you were quite in favor of having a gui test suite, I thought I share with you what I have so far.

I changed the fixed position of the special columns from the right of the maintable to the right of the URL column. I think this position makes it easier to work with these columns, because you have interesting information like read status in the beginning of the table. 

I did this by rearranging the order in which the columns are added to the maintable. Because the special columns are treated different to the basic columns, you cannot change order within  preferences.

Since `localizationUpdate` seems broken, the messages are currently not added and I'm waiting for the fix.The logic behind the java check is as follows:

1. In `gradle.build` we can define the `minRequiredJavaVersion` which is added as a value to `build.properties` as this was the most fitting place and it makes the version check quite flexible. I did not use an upper bound for the version but a boolean `allowJava9` indicator. The reasoning behind it is that a developer who is actually working on the Java 9 support just has to change this value to make JabRef start.
2. I put the version check as a method into `BuildInfo`. Other possible places would be `Globals` or when we give the build-info as a parameter then `JavaVersionCheck` itself. Suggestions?
3. The version check is called pretty early in `main` (as soon as localization is set up). I didn't bother to put the single error dialog into a separate class. Therefore, the logic of checking, showing the message and probably exiting is done directly there. Is this acceptable?

The version check itself has the only requirement to successfully access `System.getProperty(""java.version"")`. I implemented a very *optimistic* check that doesn't fail if we cannot determine or compare the versions. Only if we are sure that the used version is not sufficient, it will fail.

This will solve

Since quite some time passed since the last issue was created concerning the entry editor, I feel like this component is getting way to stable and no longer annoys users. Thinking hard about how to reintroduce the necessary amount of bugs, I hereby propose to rework the entry editor toolbar using JavaFX. 

Before:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/33519852-e35fbd2a-d7af-11e7-8982-93530fc0599a.png)

After:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/33519858-072366f8-d7b0-11e7-8a87-1ed5a63b7f23.png)

I tried to clean-up the ui as much as possible by removing a few buttons and changing the size/space.
The following buttons were removed:
- all buttons that do not have a global effect on the whole entry but are concerned with a specific field
   - ""generate bibtex key"" moved to the key field in the entry editor
   - ""find linked files"" removed completely (it was not working anyway, and nobody complained)
   - ""write metadata to pdf"" moved to file field
- ""help"": removed completely (since otherwise there was not enough space to have a nice display of the type label)

Other changes:
- left click on type label shows ""change type menu""
- the entry editor contained some (unused) code that checked the bibtex key for duplication and validity. I extracted the code and turned it into new integrity checkers.

We added a new listener that automatically updates the timestamp of changed entries if the feature is enabled in the options (""Update timestamp on modification""). The listener was added to the BasePanel class so that it could listen on the whole database to also work with changes created by other sources (like cleanup operations).

The listener is ""public static"" so that it can be accessed by the added test cases.

### Problem with dependency on JabRefPreferences

The test cases added with UpdateTimestampListenerTest cause the test [TestArchitectureTests#testsAreIndependent()](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/test/java/org/jabref/architecture/TestArchitectureTests.java#L54) to fail as the new tests are dependent on JabRefPreferences.

We were initially using Globals.prefs directly. To remove the dependency on Globals, we changed it so that a JabRefPreferences object is passed to the constructor of the listener instead. This means that the tests are only dependent on JabRefPreferences now.

But we don't know how to avoid this dependency. We tried to pass the TimeStampPreferences object directly to the constructor of the listener (which would remove the dependency). This is, however, not feasible as the TimeStampsPreferences object returned by Globals.prefs.getTimeStampPreferences() does not reflect any changes made in the options menu. This would mean that changes to the option ""Update timestamp on modification"" (or the date format) would only apply after a restart of JabRef.

We had a look online on how to test with preferences but according to the [JabRef testing how-tos](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Code-Howtos#preferences-in-tests), creating a mock object of JabRefPreferences and mocking the needed method calls should be a valid approach.

### Potentially unwanted behavior

As the timestamp is set on any change to the entry, if the user decides to change the timestamp by hand it will be reset immediately. We are not sure if this behavior is wanted or not.

3443jupf4948016closed2017-11-18T12:32:16Z2017-11-27T17:58:18ZFix for issue #3381"Because the javafx Tooltip used in the [GlobalSearchBar](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/search/GlobalSearchBar.java) cannot render HTML, @tobiasdiez recommended in #3381  to create a TextFlow object in the [SearchDescriber](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/search/rules/describer/SearchDescriber.java) classes for structuring the Text. 

I made the changes to return a TextFlow and its working fine so far without changing the logic that is used to build the text.  I moved the search.rules.describer package like proposed from the logic package to the gui package. The existing tests were moved accordingly but still needs to be rewritten for the new TextFlow results.

There are some open questions i would like to ask:

1. With no Styling of the Tooltip, the readability was really bad (black text on grey background), so I changed the styling to look like the other Tooltips in the bar. Hope it was okay to do this in the context of this issue? I created a new styleclass for this in the Main.css to not change any other styled elements.
2. the [SearchQuery](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/search/SearchQuery.java) class stores a description of the search. It is created with the SearchDescribers. But they are now inside the gui package and return a TextFlow. So there is a javafx dependency in the SearchQuery class which resides in the logic package at the moment. This doesnt sound right to me? Should the class be moved to the gui package too?
3. The [GroupDialog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/groups/GroupDialog.java) class uses a SearchQuery object to get a search description. This class is written with Swing and is not compatible to the now returned TextFlow. If I understand it right, the project is migrating to use javaFX. So I want to propose that I write a compatibility method in the GroupDialog class to create an HTML string from the given TextFlow to be compatible while the GroupDialog is still using Swing. 
4. Sadly the localized strings used in the SearchDescribers included the HTML tag elements.. So in many cases it is not possible to use existing translations.. just because the tags are gone. I'm not sure what to do about this. It could be possible to remove the tags manually from the translations. Not sure how long this would take..

That's how the tooltip looks with the changes:
![screenshot-2017-11-18--13 15 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4948016/32980197-9c017e62-cc62-11e7-86a6-b5c0c0010ac8.png)

There seems to be something wrong with the logic of the tooltip text creation, the first few words repeat itself. And it already happened prior to my changes (see the image in #3381) But I didnt had time to look very closely into this. Should I open a new issue for this problem?

I hope I didn't forget anything. I'm happy to hear your feedback!

This PR implements #1664 by adding a group that contains all entries referenced in a given aux-file. So far the code is only a prototype, but it already works really well. What is missing is that changes in the aux file are automatically recognized and handled (this should be easy to accomplish). The user interface is very very basic and only contains a text field where the user can specify the path to the aux file (in light of the upcoming rewrite of the groups dialog in javafx #2643, I don't want to spent to much time at ui stuff). 

I have two questions:
- ~~The implementation so far is against our architecture. The new group (`TexGroup`) is in the model but uses the `AuxParser` from the logic. Any ideas how to resolve this issue? More and more, I don't like the strict rule that model is not allowed to access logic - how I'm supposed to create ""intelligent"" objects in the model if they are not allowed to use advanced stuff from the logic package?~~

- The file path right now is stored as an absolute path. Is this ok? If not, what should be the ""base"" of a relative path? The bib file?

Unfortunately, we also use libraries that make such internal accesses and we need to find a solution for that.

One of these libraries is swingx. Originally by Sun, it is no longer maintained since quite a while we could not even upgrade to the newest version, because of bugs in the library. It is time to get rid of this dependency. This PR replaces the usage of swingx with regular Swing components. Only the new entries dialog and the side pane are affected. For the new entries dialog, the change is trivial (just using a regular layout manager). For the side pane, a few changes are needed, but I can make it roughly resemble the old layout. 

There's one bigger change, though, that I happen to like very much: The side panes are no longer exclusive, you can display them together. That means that I can have the web search and the groups panel open at the same time. Personally, I think that's pretty cool and I would like to keep it that way. You can of course still disable the side panes independent of each other. Here's a screenshot:

With the switch to JUnit 5, the upload of test coverage data to codecov stopped working. Hopefully, this is working again with this PR. The added code essentially comes from https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1024.

I also included the fetcher tests in the calculation of the code coverage. Was there a reason to exclude them?

Instead of assumptions, we can now disable tests on the CI server using a new `@DisabledOnCIServer` annotation. I converted the fetcher tests affected to junit 5.
Moreover, I extracted some common tests (null / empty) to a new parametrized fulltextfetcher class.

This PR removes this dependency. The biggest change is that two Look and Feels go and that particularily affects Linux users.

I have used the Nimbus Look and Feel as the new default for Linux, but we can change that or even search for better Java 9-compatible Look and Feels. I have also added a preferences migration in case a user has set one of the incompatible Look and Feels.

I would suggest that we wait with merging this after we have release 4.1. Java 9 does not yet matter for 4.1 and we should give the Linux users a stable JabRef that still has the old Look and Feels before moving on.

There were two situations I have presented a design approach:

1. The linked file has no annotations
2. The linked file has annotations

If there are annotations in the linked file, two design solution approaches have been discussed: Either realising it with a list or a table. No matter which of these solutions is chosen, it would be nice to be able to order the annotations by Date, Author or Page.
- So a table might be the clearest solution. 
- Sorting a list on the other hand side could be realised by implementing a DropDown Menu were the user can select what the list should be sorted by.

I implemented the ""No Annotations"" approach, so that the right side of the FileAnnotationTab showing the annotation's attributes is either disabled (if there are ""no annotations"" in the linked file) or enabled (if there are annotations)."10315458196
3460tobiasdiez5037600closed2017-11-27T19:49:15Z2017-12-08T09:35:14ZOnly build master branch on push"Our current workflow is to create a branch on the main JabRef fork and then open a PR for it. This, however, leads to two travis builds: one for the new push to JabRef and one for the PR.
There seems to be no elegant way to force travis to

- always build PRs
- but don't build PRs from main branches twice

See https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6612. I followed [the suggested solution on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31882307/873661) and only white-listed the master branch.
Thus pushes to master still trigger a build, as well as all PRs. However, pushes to other branches on main does not result in build. Thus only one build is executed if you open a PR from a main branch. Disadvantage: you have to open a PR to get a build from a different branch. I don't think this is a huge disadvantage since it is exactly our current workflow.

## Pros and cons of crowdin

- `+`: Easy translation interface. Users can start joining at https://crwd.in/jabref.
- `+`: Nice status overview - see https://crowdin.com/project/jabref - internal link: https://crowdin.com/project/jabref/settings#translations - fixes fixes https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues/171
- `+` Translators do not require a login at GitHub and do not need to work with pull requests etc.
- `+` Translations can still be made using our GitHub workflow
- Exclamation marks are escaped. However, this is no issue, because we unescape them: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d45d7ca381c31fab2e41e0693948b11e5068887b/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/l10n/LocalizationKey.java#L25
- `-` At least one review of the translated string is required
- `-` We cannot create [our translation status page](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/blob/gh-pages/en/TranslatingGUI.md#localization-files-status-2017-11-29-1957---branch-master-42ba568ea) anymore (using `syncLang.py`) as crowdin either (i)  does not put a key at all or (ii) puts the English translation in the properties file. Checking for equality does not help as `OK` is translated to `OK`.
- `-` It seems that generating the pull request has to be triggered manually.

I would vote to go for crowdin to make it easy for interested people to work on the translation.

## TODOs

- [ ] Check why our language file checker fails and adapt it accordingly
- [x] `id` vs `in`. Result: The ISO-Code for Indonesia changed from ""in"" to ""id"". Java uses only the old one. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html#Locale(java.lang.String), but Crowdin uses the new one. With a new mapping configuration on Crowdin, this is fixed."7012822102554335

IACR does not provide a real API, so the information needs to be parsed out of their (really simple) HTML.

@devs: Are there any special requirements for fetchers? (I couldn't find any, but the whole HTML parsing thing might be a problem concerning maintainability - on the other hand, I use IACR for quite a while now and the web interface hasn't changed (visibly at least)).

The idea is to have the following features:

- [x] Fetch based on ID (like `2017/1556`)
- [x] Fetched entry is of type `misc` and contains:
  - [x] Title
  - [x] Authors
  - [x] Url (contains the version)
  - [x] Note with `\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/<identifier>}` (recommended by IACR)
  - [x] Howpublished like `Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report <identifier>` (recommended by IACR)
  - [x] Version (most recent)
  - [x] Date (of the most recent version)
  - [x] Abstract
- [x] The encoding fits the library encoding (see b76a3f742f593e775a93997d67c94b2d954fc485, e. g. [`2017/1095`](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1095))

The following could also make sense:

- Get fulltext (if that means to download the pdf - I haven't used this feature with other fetchers yet, so I don't really know what exactly it does)
- Get the ""also published in"" information (see e.g. [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1118)) and DOI, if present (e.g. [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/119))
- Get keywords
- Search in IACR preprints (e.g. for title) - but I suspect this would require us to download the complete archive or somehow ""fill out"" their search form (by crafting the corresponding POST request) programatically

The default dialog for confirmation of delete entries is changed so the user have option to choose if he wants to delete entry, or to just remove entry from active group. I have few times deleted articles from database not being aware that article belongs to other groups. 
New dialog should make clear to user what is happening when he press ""Delete"" and offer to just remove from selected groups.

At this phase I need help with defining text in dialog, so any advice is welcome.

Attempts to fix #3498

It seems that the internal state of DatabaseChangeMonitor was not updated correctly when external changes were marked as resolved, causing the monitor to misbehave when you tried to save afterwards. I am not sure how this bug came into being and what caused the update to get lost. Adding an additional update step seems to resolve the problem, but I would really appreciate some more testing of this branch by other people.

I migrated the entry preview to JavaFX. My hope was to resolve the memory issues #2533, but this was sadly not successful (thus the issues really come from the citation style cache and not from the display). 
Notable differences:
- The default JavaFX font seems to be bigger. In my opinion, it looks better that way.
- The description for two options in the right-click menu has a display bug. The reason is that I use `lang.menuTitle` to get the text but menu titles contain the acceleration key binding. Probably one needs to convert the main toolbar to JavaFX as well in order to fix this problem.

Fixes #3472.
The auto-link algorithm just checked if the file starts with the BibTeX key. This leads to a lot of false positives since ""Einstein1902a.pdf"" is found for the entry ""Einstein1902"" although this pdf probably belongs to a second paper by Einstein that was published in the same year. 
This is fixed in this PR.
With the proposed implementation also the pdf file ""Einstein1902aboutSomething.pdf"" is no longer found (since there is really no possibility in telling the difference to ""Einstein1902a - a second paper.pdf""). Thus the user is advised to add some non-letter character after the key.

But to extract modules, there can be no cyclic dependencies among them.

The `model` package is our best candidate for extracting a new module. Here the last dependency that coupled it to transitively to everything else was the `shared` package. This PR refactors the shared package and puts most of it into `logic`. I broke the dependency from `model` by introducing a number of interface that the `logic` layer implements. These interfaces will have just one implementation now, but at least they break the dependency cycle.

This is just a refactoring, so I think it should be merged after the release of 4.1

After each sync, the translation will reappear. So we have a short time window where the translations are missing and that translators using GitHub do not see these new translations. I would accept that.

Fixes #2852

1. The input field for the group search is delayed now. It waits until the user has finished typing and starts the search afterward. This increases the usability and prevents lags during typing.
2. The RecursiveTreeElement caches the current predicate so that branches of the group tree are not tested over and over again. This is an ugly solution so far but we need to test if this or something similar (but beautiful) boosts the performance considerably.

Fixes  #3576.
I refactored the export package so that it now has a similar structure of the importer and a similar code can now be used for imports and exports. Since the issue #3576 didn't occurred for imports, this refactoring automatically fixes the problem for the export.

Notable changes:
- `ExportFormat` is renamed to `Exporter`
- `ExportFormats` is renamed to `ExportFactory` and no longer static.
- `FileExtensions` is renamed to `FileType`

for the past 4-5 years with the goal of getting people involved in
Open Source projects like this one. The app sends subscribers a random
open issue for them to help ""triage"". For some languages you can also
suggested areas to add documentation.

The initial approach was inspired by seeing the work of the small
core team spending countless hours asking ""what version was
this in"" and ""can you give us an example app"". The idea is to
outsource these small interactions to a huge team of volunteers
and let the core team focus on their work.

I want to add a badge to the README of this project. The idea is to
provide an easy link for people to get started contributing to this
project. A badge indicates the number of people currently subscribed
to help the repo. The color is based off of open issues in the project.

Here are some examples of other projects that have a badge in their
README:

- https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal
- https://github.com/rails/rails
- https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage

Please report any bugs that appear or missing features, which are not listed below. Moreover, we appreciate feedback about the general design (what do guys like, what not)

Known bugs:
--
- [ ] Some input controls (like check boxes) look odd
- [ ] Smaller things outlined [here](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-369646377) and [here](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-378598558)
- [ ] Drag & drop to and from the table does not work #3765 
- [ ] Ranking is not shown (and thus not editable)
- [ ] Float mode does not work (partly because of [unresolved feature request for Java](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8091326))  [code to fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37768326/group-by-function-in-javafx-table)
- [ ] Linux / Mac OS: Resizing the columns per drag & drop does not work nicely (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-368821666)
- [ ] Linux: Column separator are not shown on hover (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-368821666)
- [ ] Performance of search is poor for large databases https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1513#issuecomment-361528430
- [x] <s>Magnifier icon is not colored correctly - we accept that workaround until we implement something really cool as proposed at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3535</s> Follow up at https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/341
- [x] <s>Mouse wheel for tabs in entry editor works in the wrong way - up/down reversed in comparison to Firefox (by @koppor)</s> Follow up at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4089
- [x] <s>When in the maintable, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> does not focus the search field  (by @koppor)</s> Follow up at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3062
- [x] Import does not work, see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-387529415
- [x] Trailing thread even after JabRef is closed https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-372785852
- [x] The colors have to harmonized and sometimes the text is hard to read (black on dark background e.g. in the search or for active rows). Reported in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3678#issuecomment-367321389.
- [x] Deleting of entries does not work, leads to exception
- [x] When columns are reorded by drag & drop, then the new order is not saved (i.e. lost after closing JabRef)
- [x] Reordering of tabs using drag'n'drop is not possible any more (by @koppor): [code to fix](https://github.com/sibvisions/javafx.DndTabPane) or wait until [Java 10](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8187074)
- [x] Columns cannot be resized even if there is an <-> arrow indicated that it would be possible (by @koppor)
- [x] The size of the entry editor sometimes resets leading to a very small editor
- [x] The columns are slightly sized too large if a vertical scrollbar is visible
- [x] The icons in the right toolbar of the entry editor are sized to small
- [x] Saving a file leads to an IllegalStateException
- [x] The searchbar sometimes steals the focus from the maintable.
- [x] JabRef might no longer start on MacOS https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3267#issuecomment-361511845
- [x] JabRef might freeze on Linux https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3373#issuecomment-361757196
- [x] CTRL + TAB does only sometimes work. The toolbar steals the focus. Might be fixed by #3684 
- [x] Changes to entries don't mark database as changed.
- [x] File annotation tab is not shown and throws exception https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-361647223
- [x] Paste of new entries does not work
- [x] It is no longer possible to select multiple entries by holding mouse button: [code to fix](https://community.oracle.com/thread/2621389)

Changelog:
--
Fixed:
- Italic text is now rendered correctly. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3356
- The entry editor no longer gets corrupted after using the source tab. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3532 https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3608 https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3616
- We fixed multiple issues where entries did not show up after import if a search was active. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1513 https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3219
- We fixed an issue where the group tree was not updated correctly after an entry was changed. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3618
- We fixed an issue where a right-click in the main table selected a wrong entry. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3267
- We fixed an issue where in rare cases entries where overlayed in the main table. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3281
- We fixed an issue where selecting a group messed up the focus of the main table / entry editor. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3367
- We fixed an issue where composite author names were sorted incorrectly. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2828
- We fixed an issue where the custom file column were sorted incorrectly. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3119
- We fixed an issues where the entry losses focus when a field is edited and at the same time used for sorting. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3373
- We fixed an issue where the menu on Mac OS was not displayed in the usual Mac-specific way. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3146
- We fixed an issue where the groups tree of the last database was still shown even after the database was already closed.
- We fixed an issue where the ""Open file dialog"" may disappear behind other windows. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3410
- We fixed an issue where the default icon of a group was not colored correctly.
- We reworked the ""Edit file"" dialog to make it resizeable and improved the workflow for adding and editing files https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2970
- We fixed an issue where the month was not shown in the preview https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3239.

Changed:
- The special fields like `Printed` and `Read status` now show gray icons when the row is hovered.
- We added a button in the tab header which allows you to close the database with one click. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/494
- Sorting in the main table now takes information from cross-referenced entries into account. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2808
- If a group has a color specified, then entries matched by this group have a small colored bar in front of them in the main table.
- Change default icon for groups to a circle because a colored version of the old icon was hard to distinguish from its black counterpart.
- In the main table, the context menu appears now when you press the ""context menu"" button on the keyboard. [feature request in the forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/t/how-to-enable-keyboard-context-key-windows)
- We added icons to the group side panel to quickly switch between `union` and `intersection` group view mode https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3269

Removed:
- The feature to ""mark entries"" was removed and merged with the groups functionality.  For migration, a group is created for every value of the `__markedentry` field and the entry is added to this group.
- The number column was removed.
- We removed the coloring of cells in the maintable according to whether the field is optional/required.
- We removed a few commands from the right-click menu that are not needed often and thus don't need to be placed that prominently:
  - Print entry preview: available through entry preview
  - All commands related to marking: marking is not yet reimplemented
  - Set/clear/append/rename fields: available through Edit menu
  - Manage keywords: available through Edit menu
  - Copy linked files to folder:  available through File menu
  
Migrated features:
- [x] Sorting (Shift + click for multi-column sort)
- [x] Filtering by search and groups 
- [x] Context menu (with linked files) for the file icon
- [x] Right-click menu
- [x] Setting special fields like reading status / priority / ... through the main table
  
I would like to ask all contributors with write-access to complete the lists above (with links to a comment with further details if necessary) with new bugs or missing features as they are discovered."49111342918248294491

In the DevCall, we decided, that we will try to use Gitter and see how it goes.

The main arguments were:
- easy to join for new users
- offer help for new developers since the burden of initial JabRef development is high for newcomers - even if we have https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/High-Level-Documentation and https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Code-Howtos
- Nearly none of the developers uses Slack
- does not clutter the Skype chat of the developers
- developers can use [pinned tabs](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pinned-tabs-keep-favorite-websites-open) to keep gitter always opened

We will shutdown gitter in case there won't be much support from @JabRef/developers there (because lack of time). Nevertheless, we give it a chance. 😇 "302012

I restructured the readme, mainly adding a more detailed overview of the features. I don't know how many potential users come to github first, but I doubt that [all 1000 visitors per week on github](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/graphs/traffic) are developers. Thus this more user-centrist rework.

I had a closer look at the export / layout logic and wow, this is arcane! The code is more than 12 years old and almost as bad as the bibtex parser used to be.

This PR is based on two decisions:
 - I do not want to change the old layouting code. If I do, I am almost guaranteed to break it in many ways.
- I do not know if the removal of empty lines in exported text is really desirable in all cases. Maybe users wrote their custom formatters to explicitly include empty lines? I cannot tell.

We now have one case (RIS export) where empty lines are not desired. So, I implemented a solution that only changes the behavior of the RIS export, but leaves all others untouched. Nonetheless, it is very easy (single constructor parameter) to let other formats use empty line elimination as well. 

The empty line elimination is done using a hardly understandable, but fully functional regex.

This is tracked here: #3645 I think this is a huge problem, because we are missing out on a lot of validation here. 

This PR is a migration of the paramterized RIS tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. I'd like to put this forward to discussion, so that we can agree on how our parameterized JUnit 5 tests are to look like. When we have agreed, we can migrate all tests. So, please look at the code and write if you are happy with this.

[Note that parameters cannot be resolved for lifecycle methods](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-lifecycle-interop) (`@BeforeEach`) in JUnit 5, hence the structure in the PR.

Removed a few commands that are not needed often and thus don't need to be placed that prominently.
- Print entry preview: available through entry preview
- All commands related to marking: marking is not yet reimplemented
- Set/clear/append/rename fields: available through Edit menu
- Manage keywords: available through Edit menu
- Copy linked files to folder:  available through File menu

Changes in the architecture:
- Previously, an `Action` defined both the visual properties (text, icons, ...) as well as the behavior. These actions are usually defined in the base panel (or main frame).
- Now the visual elements are defined by an `ActionFX` (to be renamed to `Action` as soon as the old class can be removed) and the behavior by implementing the `Command` interface. This separation makes it possible to reuse the visual aspects without the ties to the behavior.
- In the long term, the commands should be defined outside of the main big classes. This is not done in this PR, because then the scope and size would explode. The extraction is best done peu à peu.

With this PR the new maintable support again the following gesture to select entries: click on one row and hold mouse button, then move over other rows to also select them.

The view does not scroll when you move the curser to the border and thus currently it is only possible to select rows in the current view using the method described above. To enable scrolling needs further research on my part and thus is something for a new PR.

With this PR the main frame is converted to use JavaFX. Thus the role is now inverted and instead of embedding JavaFX in a Swing app, we now embedded the old Swing controls in a real JavaFX app. Hopefully, this leads to less problems.

The current state is very very basic and a lot of stuff is missing (side bar, menu, lila header instead of toolbar). The main reason for putting it out right now is to test if pushing the migration further fixes the issues encountered with Linux and MacOS.
@Siedlerchr @LinusDietz could you please try out this version and see if JabRef starts and shows a maintable (the latter only works if JabRef normally opens a bib file for you, since there is currently no GUI to open a new file).

A few visual improvements for the new maintable.
As it should be for a ""visual PR"", I only had to touch the stylesheet - I love JavaFX ;-).

- Use the same color for the focus of text-input as for the other controls (e.g. tabs, selected row)

* When a file link in a bibliography entry is deleted by the user, a dialog is displayed. Previously, the default (first) dialog option deleted the linked file from disk. The default behaviour has been changed to just removing the file link from the entry.

  This is a fix to issue #3679 
Fixes #3679 

* When clicking the ""Cancel"" button in the file link deletion dialog, the file  was being deleted from the list. This behaviour has been fixed by changing the return value of the `delete()` method when the ""Cancel"" button is chosen.

I am unsure whether the remaining checklist items are applicable to this pull request.
I would be willing to provide tests for the `delete()` method; however, the `DialogService` member cannot be stubbed-in/mocked as it is (as it is marked `final`), and therefore I can't control the returned chosen option from inside the unit test.

I would appreciate any pointers and suggestions."57157453

I have several questions:
1. I'm not sure about using `compareSingleField` function for comparing chapters, because sometimes they are very similar, but different, for instance: 'chapter 1' and 'chapter 2'. Any idea? My is to remove 'chapter' word from strings and then make the comparison. 
2. Should I also add test for incollections?
3. What about pages? As I noticed they can be a replacement for chapters. Should I consider them in the code?
4. Can I add another commits with some cleanup and refactor for the files I've touched? I mean adding some finals to make code less error prone etc.

This enables gradle multi module build.

The dependencies of ""logic"" were not as clean as I thought. I removed dependencies to GUI or moved packages back to gui (shared, remote).

We should get this in ASAP. 

Open issues:

- [ ] `src/main/gen` should be removed from version control - generated code like jabref.gui/src/main/gen/org/jabref/logic/importer/fileformat/mods/RoleTermDefinition.java is put under version control; is this desired?
- [ ] inherit more from root project avoid duplication of plugins dependencies and tasks (https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html)
- [x] GUI does not start: `Cannot load file GroupTree.fxml`
- [x] Install4J does not find the generated JARs.
- [x] The OO preferences should be fixed (reading/writing not fully supported yet). All other features should work. - done in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3913
- [x] `jar` are not uploaded to CircleCI - are they stored somewhere else? http://builds.jabref.org/multi-module-build/
- [x]  Tests not executed on travis. `:org.jabref.gui:junitPlatformTest`  - this works locally though.

However, the icon refuses a color change. It even opts out of the color scheme of JabRef, since it is black instead of purple (despite the fact that the icon is configured as purple in the code).

@tobiasdiez How can I change the color of this icon? Any change will do, really. For reasons unknown to me the icon straight-out refuses the change.

So far, changing the type of an entry did not update the type label in the entry editor or the structure of its tabs, which might offer different fields for a different type.

This turns the type attribute of `BibEntry` into a property so that it is possible to listen to this property and to react to changes. It also adds a `ChangeListener` to the `EntryEditor` that updates the label and the contents of the visible tab.

@tobiasdiez It would be cool if you could have a quick look at the listener related stuff to check that I remove it correctly and do not introduce any memory leaks.

I was actually surprised to find that no one attacked the issue so far. These were really just a few minor changes. Ultimately, the `Abbreviation` class is still flawed, because it violates the equals contract and we use it in a `Set`. That's why the code might look strange. Nevertheless, it is the fix suggested in the issue.

Fixes https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/294
<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->
I think that the issue is not with the junior suffix. 
first I tried to implement a new method but it didn't make any sense
I have tested inputs examples in the form fName lName,fName lName,fName lName,fName lName.....
so the problem is always with the ""and"" that comes before the Last author's name
before normalizing i added replaceAll method that replaces all and sepertaing between two names with a comma to get to my tested case and then normalizing it...

Instead of ""marking entries"" to highlight them, the entries in the maintable now have a small colored bar in front of them whose color comes from the first group that matches them (see picture below). For migration, a group is created for every value of the `__markedentry` field and the entry is added to this group.

- Fixed an issue where the default icon of a group was not colored correctly.

This PR removes all the old code related to color customization of the maintable. In principle, it is possible to allow a similar customization also with JavaFX, but it is way easier to let the user switch between themes defined in different css files. The complexity of the current approach is perhaps best illustrated by the huge number of lines which are removed with  this PR. At some point, we should discuss how we facilitate the development / embedding of new themes, but this is not the purpose of this PR.

At the moment, I used a flat and bright scheme with the original JabRef blue as the theme color.

![scrShot](http://i.imgur.com/kOSJWNW.png)

In addition to the changes in the FX CSS files, I provide an additional true type font for the application icons that are not available in the Material Design Icon set. It can be loaded and used in exactly the same way as the Material Design Icons and only small changes to the code where necessary. As soon as we agreed on using this, I can make further adjustments and additions (currently, WinEd is missing) to the icons so that they fit perfectly into our toolbar. The one-colored icons should represent the original icon as much as possible and should be recognizable. The will look like this

For those who would like to help to work on this:

Our base style is `modena.css` and to make our restyling easy to use and to understand, we should try to redefine the color variables of `modena.css` as much as possible instead of explicitly introducing and using our own variables. This means, don't use explicit color settings in the definition of styles for a control. If it is a commonly used property e.g. the border color, try to find and overwrite the appropriate modena-variable. If you indeed need a specific color, then re-use the ones defined at the top of `Main.css`.

Remember that this is unfinished at the moment and I have rather commented out lines than simply deleting it.

With this PR, working on styling and css files should be easier. Css files are now watched for changes and automatically reloaded. Thus JabRef does not have to be restarted in order to apply a new design. In IntellJ you can now start debugging, edit the css and apply the changes by `Build > Build project` or `Run > Reload Changed Classes`. 

The idea of the `ThemeLoader` class is to support external css files (next to the jar file) in the future so that users could change the theme on their own.

I'll add a short note documenting this feature to the wiki after this PR gets merged.

InvalidFieldValueExceptions are no longer printed into the log when they occur during autosave. Fields in the entry editor still have the warning sign next to them.

The normal save operation (CTRL+S) still triggers a warning dialog, saying that the file could not be saved.

Right now it is pretty difficult to create dialogs in JavaFX using FXML. For once, you have to create a bunch of files (fxml, view, controller, view model) and there are huge problems with passing data between the caller and the controller (e.g., no complex objects, cumbersome injection setup,...).

So I took the opportunity to rewrite parts of the afterburner framework to make the workflow more fluid. With these changes, the view class is merged with the controller and it is very easy to pass data to and from the controller. In particular, the code in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3005 should become much simpler.

Moreover, I started to embed the content of a few Swing dialogs (cleanup and preferences) in a JavaFX window. This is kind of proof of concept, works pretty nicely in my opinion and is probably the only way to fix the z-hierarchy issues with the old swing dialogs. 

Git is not able to properly sort-out some of the changes (the merge of the view and controller classes) and shows a pretty huge diff. If git gurus like @koppor know a way to fix this, feel free to hijack this PR.

A bit refactoring around FXML files (see commit messages for details). Most notable change is the introduction of `JabRefIconView` which makes it possible to use the `JabRefIcons` enum in FXML files, which help to have a consistent usage of icons across JabRef.

I tried to implement #3885 but changes of the file type in the linked file editor are not saved for some reason. I'll investigate this again after https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3005 is merged.
Thus only some relative minor code improvements / fixes:
- Refactor external file type classes and extract a common `ExternalFileType` interface.
- Extract all built-in file types to separate enum (implementing `ExternalFileType`)
- Fix display of External file type editor dialog (which is not shown in the current maintable-beta version)

This PR adds a dark theme. Based on the wonderful work of @halirutan, this was really easy and only a handful of colors had to be changed. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5037600/37995234-fc2cadcc-3213-11e8-8408-480c70263317.png)
The highlight color is taken from the icon that won the design contest last year. In the end, the dark theme is more a Spielerei from my side to test how nicely the JavaFX styling works and I definitely think we should provide a light theme as the default.

The dark theme was also a nice test because it revealed a few 1-px wide borders, shadows and other small stuff. Based on these discoveries, I also changed the light theme a bit. These changes are just a proposal and are open for discussion. In my opinion, the light theme still needs a bit of love until it is finished (e.g. I find the side pane should be colored in a darker color to better distinguish it from the main table and the background color of the header looks a bit ""dirty"".)

So I went through the BSD ones and ensure their license info is correct now. Two points worth mentioning:

- jgoodies form 1.9.0 is no longer downloadable. Most recent available version is 1.8.0, so I checked its license and assume it did not change.
- antlr v3 has an alternative website now, so I changed its URL too.

Also fixed the ID ""Apache 2.0"" to ""Apache-2.0"". Didn't really look into each project with non-BSD license though.

This initial commit adds a button to the settings panel for each external application which allows the user to select an application to make default. There is currently a problem with this build where the application will not update the pushToApplicationButton. I believe the issue has something to do with the interaction between javafx and swing components.

With these changes, the `checkstyle` task is no longer invoked as part of the `build` or `check` task. The `checkstyleMain` task and its variations are kept. 

Reason: The build fails as soon as the checkstyle task fails, possibly hiding more important build or test failures (recent [example](https://travis-ci.org/JabRef/jabref/builds/371621951?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification)). Moreover, the checkstyle task is invoked as a separate build command on travis anyway.

RFC, an additional ID-based entry generator ID type, has been added in order to fetch more complete BibTeX data compared to DOI fetches of RFC type.

Following the DiVA ID type classes as template, an RFC fetcher class and fetcher test has been added.
I added RFC to the ID-based entry generator list within WebFetchers so it is an option in the dialog's dropdown.

Currently, the RFC fetcher class accepts search requests with or without the ""rfc"" prefix--is this an okay feature?

Additionally, help in finding the best [RFC BibTeX API](https://www.rfc-editor.org/retrieve/). I am using the API referenced in [#3971](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3971).

Fixed several issues with the Custom Exporter.
- Filename check for layout files was wrong 
- Commandline name for custom exports was the filename and not the name, opposed to what our help says 
- Custom exports could not be added due to our hardcoded enum

In [the forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/t/postgresql-connection-jabref-4-0-4-1-4-2/1113), there were some reports that the postgre SQL integration sometimes fails due to a bug in the sql driver we use. It appears that the driver [pgjdbc-ng](https://github.com/impossibl/pgjdbc-ng) is no longer maintained and all the features we need are present in the [""official driver""](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc). Thus I switched to the later in the hope that it fixes the issues mentioned in the forum.

When working with persons quickly creating their bibliography, the solution is to put `{}` around the `title` field. Up to now, JabRef supports the inverse feature by the `RemoveBracesFormatter`. This PR adds the `AddBracesFormatter`. I am very aware that the other formatters such as our `org.jabref.logic.formatter.casechanger.ProtectTermsFormatter`. However, that formatter relies on a fixed list of terms, whereas this `AddBracesFormater` ""just works"" (under some assumptions).

The printUsage method is used twice. The JabRefCLI prints the usage, if an error occurs during argument parsing and the ArgumentProcessor prints the usage, when --help option is chosen. 

I made two solutions for this problem:
 - Commit 1: Some sort of a hack to only get the names of the exporters without altering the processing in the main method.

 - Commit 2: Changed the order of execution in the main method. The argument processor needs the export factory. I don't know, if the processing of the preferences will influence the cli functionality?

(Partly) fixes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4025. Right-click on a group no longer focuses that group. It's not perfect since there is no longer feedback on which group the user clicked and the context menu belongs to.  

Clicking the disclosure node (the small arrow) still leads to an immediate selection of the group. The selection happens before any events are triggered on the row and thus I'm not able to intercept the selection.

Fixes #4093. Since Java does not automatically update to 171, users have to manually install the 172 update. This is very convenient. 

I actually propose to cherry-pick this PR to 4.x and immediately release 4.3.1.

The problem are LaTeX commands, which are not resolved before executing special formatters for all fields.

I tried to remove the `System.exit` call so that JabRef shutdown smoothly. However, currently an AWT-thread does not want to exit. In order to solve this problem, I removed most calls that would init the AWT toolkit. This includes:
- Use JavaFX clipboard instead of AWT
- Remove L&F and font customization

Moreover, the Azure telemetry SDK has a bug https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/662 that prevents certain threads from terminating. I added the workaround mentioned in this issue.

I played around a bit with the aim of improving the startup time. Ignore the code for the moment.
One of the biggest contribution comes from `ClassLoader.loadClass`:

@JabRef/developers Any idea why class loading is so slow? Do we mess with the classpath at some point or do other customization in this regard?

It works, now you can have a preview of a selected citation style. I am not sure if it is the correct way of programming it though. Let me now if I should do it in some other way or try a different approach.

Fixes #3805. Now commands terminated by a hyphen (like `\edition-`) work correctly.

Way back in 2011, Morten added the extra check for hyphens (commit 392bc7a6dd215eb23766378aa90e3995d0847bb7). However, I'm not aware of any field that has a dash in it, so I'm not sure what was the reason for the change (I couldn't find an old bug report).

Also refactored a bit the layout tests.

Previously, the DOAJ fetcher was able to get all results by pagination. This version is restricted to the first 20 entries; I think, this is enough for the moment.

The OAI2 fetcher is nowhere used and thus can be removed. It actually would be nice to have a fetcher that supports tho OAI2 interface (so that we may implement further fetchers more easily in the future). However, the current implementation still uses the old fetcher infrastructure and thus reenabling it would almost amount to a complete rewrite anyway.

The Springer fetcher is now implemented according to the new fetcher infrastructure. Instead of pagination support, the fetcher now only returns the first 20 items matched by the search query. 

I used the opportunity and fixed a few small things: url to pdf is now added as online file link (instead of in the url field) and the ending page is correctly parsed.

Converts the ACM fetcher to the new infrastructure and deletes a lot of gui code that is now no longer needed. Notable changes:
- Fetcher no longer visits each citation page separately but uses the batch export provided by ACM
- Fetcher always queries the full ACM Guide to Computing Literature (previously there was also the option to use the ACM Full-Text collection, which is however completely contained in the former).
- Abstracts are no longer returned (they are simply not exported by ACM)
- All fetcher now use the class `URLDownload` to make the request, and thereby pretend to be Firefox (otherwise we were blocked by ACM). I remember I had a discussion with @stefan-kolb recently about this, but don't remember the outcome.

This removes `AbstractWorker` completely (where Spin was mainly used). All `AbstractWorker`s were
migrated to `BaseAction` using `BackgroundTask`s. This also simplifies `BasePanel` at some points.

Most workers could easily be wrapped in a `BackgroundTask`, as all they do on the UI Thread is call `JabRefFrame.output("".."")` which is already executed on the UI Thread internally.

Some workers were joined with their corresponding actions as all the actions did, was calling the workers.

Add a small script that removes merged branches. Normally, git provides a few commands that detect merged branches (`git branches --merged`) and deletes obsolete ones (`git prune`). However, these commands do not work for PRs that were squashed. 

The script below goes through all github PR's and deletes the corresponding local branches if the PR was merged.

The IEEE fetcher now also fits in the new infrastructure and is converted to use the new IEEE API. The original fetcher performed a quite ""sophisticated"" cleanup of some fields. I'm not sure if this was needed because of scraping the webpage / a buggy BibTeX export or because the data is inherently faulty. After looking at the JSON response of some queries it appears that these cleanups are no longer necessary.

The dependencies were extracted to a separate file. This makes it much easier in the future to define shared dependencies across multiple modules, without duplicating them in the build scripts and especially keeping them all updated to the same version.

According to Gradle's guide on [writing maintainable build scripts](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/authoring_maintainable_build_scripts.html), build scripts should not contain any imperative logic but just declarative language elements. Imperative logic should live as plugins in the `buildSrc` directory. So I extracted the ANTLR tasks to this directory. This also makes it much easier to move the tasks to another module in the future.

What do you think? I would like to extract the XJC-, release-, and localization-tasks to separate plugins if you approve these changes.

Font size customization was removed in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/4109 since it didn't work properly (i.e. only some elements of the ui were scaled). With this PR the global font size can be controlled by the user (in the Appearance tab of the preference dialog) and changes there affect every JavaFX control.

As usual with these kind of freezes, it was again a problem with the interaction of Swing and JavaFX... it still has the problem that the dialog sometimes opens in the background (I've no idea how to fix it except converting the dialog to JavaFX).

(Still does not a win a prize of great ui design - e.g. the search button should be displayed as a real button; to be improved in further PRs)

Notable other changes:
- Remove all remnants of the old fetcher infrastructure (yeah!)
- Slightly improve command line output when using the `-f` (fetcher) option
- Enable web search and groups pane by default
- Fix bug where web search pane was not shown at start if it was active in last session

This fixes some of the issues mentioned in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4190, namely that swing dialogs are hidden behind the main window. They are still not modal and not centered at the screen since for this a Swing frame is needed as the owner or parent...but I couldn't find a way to convert our JavaFX main window to a Swing frame or window.

The name has to be identical with the Application.

2) Since Ubuntu 18.04 uses JabRef3, which ruins the grouping of JabRef4, just by starting JabRef! (automatic opening last files and autosave?!?), you should use JabRef4 using java -jar ~/${[[:Folder To Your Jabref:]]}/JabRef-4.3.1.jar
For more details see (Only for the germans developers): https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/JabRef/ (which should be updated (I think that's the first place to search for Germanspeakings), it says the newest 2.9 version can be installed using sourceforge, maybe you should refer to http://help.jabref.org/en/Installation, which might also should be updated to Ubuntu 18.04.)

3) The icon does not work
You might should specify that it should be downloaded from:
https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/resources/images/external/JabRef-icon-128.png
and should be stored f.e. in ~/.local/share/icons/

# Removed hyphens and newlines of highlighted text

I removed all new lines which **don't have preceded `.` or `:`** becaues I think `.` or `:` is often used to start a new paragraph.

Test text:

<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upupming/paste/master/img/test-selection.png"" width=300/>

Test result:

<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upupming/paste/master/img/20180802201505.png""/>

There is another problem with the regular expression `(\r?\n|\r)` when I try to use `(?<![.|:])(\r?\n|\r)` for excluding the new line end with `.` or `:`. 

If it's on Windows, the `\r\n` will be replaced with a whitespace, and it is OK. However if we encounter `.\r\n`, the `.\r` will be reserved and the `\n` will be replaced by a whitespace. In this way, the `.\r` will not be shown as new line int the field, and we don't need this whitespace. So instead we should change `.\r\n` to `\r\n` directly.

So I use java's `%n` to distinguish new line wisely.

But I am not sure whether it's necessary to add defalut editor menu. If not the menu item list would be:
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36831746/43885580-e411765e-9beb-11e8-99b2-6a8756bf0cd1.png)


I have run `./gradlew check` but failed. But even if I switch to the master branch which is the same as JabRef/master, the build still failed with the same error message like:
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36831746/43886264-c4c4b8d6-9bed-11e8-9126-e3a0a3ac82d6.png)
But it seems that I did not modify related classes. I don't know what went wrong. It confuses me a lot.

I am looking forward to your feedback.

[#3959](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3959)
We migrate some packages imported from JUnit4 to JUnit5, such as org.junit.Test --> org.junit.jupiter.api.Test,  org.junit.experimental.categories.Category --> org.junit.jupiter.api.Tag, and so on. 
At the same time, we slightly modify some codes which rely on those packages and doesn't apply to JUnit5 but applys to JUnit4. For example,  we change @Test(excepted = XXX.class) into using assertThrows and lambda, @Category(XXX.class) into @Tag(“XXX”)  , @Before into @BeforeEach , and so on.

Hi, I'm trying to fix the issue #3959 , and I have some problems here. Can someone help me?

**1. Some tests don't seem to have a parameter source**
Such as  `BibTeXMLExporterTest.java`, `MSBibExportFormatTestFiles.java`, `ModsExportFormatTestFiles.java`, and so on. Since I can't get feedback from both Travis CI and my IDE, I couldn't do anything at the moment.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997706-ee482a88-9e15-11e8-9b43-9b9f9853c150.png)


**2. Something about the external libraries**
For `MainArchitectureTestsWithArchUnit.java`, 
`testCompile 'com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit:0.8.3'` **isn't enough for migrate this test to JUnit 5.**
Just a few days ago, `ArchUnit` just supported tests with only JUnit 5 package. But this feature needs a `testCompile 'com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit:0.9.0` and as far as I know, this version has not been released yet.
For `CiteKeyBasedFileFinderTest.java`, I haven't found an extension in JUnit 5 for the `MockitoJUnitRunner.class` in JUnit 4. And it seems that their (mock) official version hasn't been release yet, too.


**3. The Database Test**
As I can see, those tests have already been migrated partly to JUnit 5. But the rest of it is the PROBLEM.
I've tried to migrate `DBMSProcessorTest.java` , but the code is no longer concise after that.
For example, 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997780-26078368-9e18-11e8-9fce-43d293fedf88.png)
this is the old version, and
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997784-3e0ae356-9e18-11e8-8073-d43eeb12f0d5.png)
that is the new version. And that is only part of it.
The reason is that I couldn't pass the parameters to the `@BeforeEach` method in JUnit 5, but JUnit 4 can use those local variable to pass the parameters. I think this is where the difference occurred.


**4. The GUI Test**
I just change the `@Category` annotation to `@Tag` annotation, as I have known that those tests are mostly obsolete.


**5. About CleanupWorkerTest**
This test is not hard to migrate from JUnit 4 to 5. But when I finish, and run the tests on my IDE, two tests failed. And the error message is quite weird. It seems that the worker doesn't work in JUnit 5 tests.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997847-be8c685a-9e19-11e8-9c3a-a911d9daeafe.png)


And if there are any errors or something can be improved in other tests that I didn't mention, please let me know! Thanks!

Hello, we convert part of the Issue #3861 ,  Library-> New Entry Dialog, to Javafx. We add 2 files, fxml file for the layout of the dialog, and EntryTypeView.java for the controller of the dialog. We also delete the old file (EntryTypeDialog.java) and changed the related files to fit the new dialog. There is no big change in the logic parts.

Here is our screenshot of the dialog.

I have done some changes about convert the swing dialogs to javafx.
It's about Quality->Cleanup Entries.

But when the component became the node, it doesn't work. I mean these checkbox won't change its value when I click them.

This is a complete rework of the file writing logic. Since this is the most essential part of JabRef, I would kindly ask to every @JabRef/developers to have a look at the code (at least on the new `AtomicOutputStream` which does the hard work).

The new strategy for saving the bib file is as follows:
- Create a backup (with .bak suffix) of the original file in the same directory as the destination file (if set in preferences).
- Write to a temporary file (with .tmp suffix) in the same directory.
- Create a save-backup (with .sav suffix) of the original file (if it exists) in the same directory.
- Move the temporary file to the correct place, overwriting any file that already exists at that location.
- Delete the save-backup file.

What is not clear to me is how one should handle (almost) concurrent saving processes of different users to the same file. Is it enough to lock a file (`nio.FileLock`) and if yes, which (the tmp?)?

This pull request allows the user to pick the dark theme option in the preferences box. After the user restarts the application the UI would have the dark theme in it. I also added the dark theme in the preferences box. An critique on my coding will be greatly appreciated.

Since these notifications have a rather great visual weight, we may revisit some of the existing notifications that are trivial/not useful and remove them.

I tired to fix the above issue. But I have the problem that the column sort listener is never fired when the sort order is DESCENDING. 

Edit// I also fixed an FX Threading error  when opening a new library (the snackbar output was not onFX Thread)

@tobiasdiez  Any idea if I did sth wrong oder have to set the value somewhere else?

Fix  #4329  

The underlying problem is the same as in #4152 
However, I came up with a workaround for MSOffice. 
1. Getting the original field
2. Check for corporate author (braces start and end)
3. get latex free value
4. Readd braces for corporate 
5. Parse author

The only edgecase which can occur if the entry starts with an author in latex braces and ends with an author in latex braces. That one will probably be interpreted as corporate.

This is what I have so far.  The problem is that most, but not all of the time, when I run the ""Set up general fields"" dialog, there is a problem with ViewLoader and the program throws an error.  Perhaps it is because I left the view model unfinished?

Potential fix for [#4306](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4306). 
The method ``performNameConflictCheck`` added in ``LinkedFileViewModel`` helps check whether or not the filename is already equal to the suggested filename. If so, it returns true, otherwise, it returns false. This method is then called in ``LinkedFilesEditor`` during ``createContextMenuForFile()`` to decide whether or not the Rename, Move, or Rename and Move menu options are to be disabled.

The method itself works as I tested it by running the code live with the JVM. Having the filename == suggested filename indeed disabled those three menu options in the context menu. The issue however, is that I'm having trouble writing my test case for it. I'm running into a couple of nullpointers being thrown when I try to run my test case ``checkNameConflict()`` in ``LinkedFileViewModelTest``. Specifically, it reports that there are nullpointers when accessing the ``getSuggestedFilename()`` called in within ``checkNameConflict`` in the ``LinkedFileViewModel`` class.

This approach is now more dedicated to the XML docbook export and not applied to all fields as the first PR was.

The reason for the original code was to fix #3046,  however I couldn't reproduce the issue mentioned there after I removed it. The custom entry types dialog effectively prevents you from adding from the same field twice.

Since `SpecialFieldMenuAction` has been removed and in `RightClickMenu` the following has been removed, the icons are not set correctly anymore.

```
    public static void populateSpecialFieldMenu(JMenu menu, SpecialField field, JabRefFrame frame) {
        SpecialFieldViewModel viewModel = new SpecialFieldViewModel(field);
        menu.setText(viewModel.getLocalization());
        menu.setIcon(viewModel.getRepresentingIcon());
        for (SpecialFieldValue val : field.getValues()) {
            menu.add(new SpecialFieldMenuAction(new SpecialFieldValueViewModel(val), frame));
        }
    }
```

The new way of working is through `ActionFactory` which uses `setGraphic()` instead:

```
    private static void setGraphic(MenuItem node, Action action) {
        node.graphicProperty().unbind();
        action.getIcon().ifPresent(icon -> node.setGraphic(icon.getGraphicNode()));
    }
```

Since the only composite icons are the ones used for rank, using the full `unicode` field of `Node` instead of only the unicode of the first icon won't affect other Actions.

```
    @Override
    public Node getGraphicNode() {
        GlyphIcons icon = icons.get(0);

        Text text = new Text(icon.unicode()); //Replaced with unicode
        text.getStyleClass().add(""glyph-icon"");
        text.setStyle(String.format(""-fx-font-family: %s;"", icon.fontFamily()));

        color.ifPresent(color -> text.setStyle(text.getStyle() + String.format(""-fx-fill: %s;"", ColorUtil.toRGBCode(color))));
        return text;
    }

So I tried it, and find out an issue that you can not save preference. ""Save"" button have no response. The issue starts from _Provide access to dark theme in preferences_ (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/4372). 

The reason is that default value for key ""fxTheme"" is not set, thus cause a null exception when access this option. Solution is simple, just to set default value ""Base.css"" for key ""fxTheme"" in preference.

Finally, I have to say dark theme is a great job. thanks

This builds the citation styles directly into the JabRef JAR.

Tested also in the `jdk9` branch.

This PR does *not* remove the dependency on `org.citationstyles:locales:1.0.1-SNAPSHOT`, where I assume the same problem exists, however, I'm unsure where or even if that dependency is used.

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [archunit-junit5-engine's releases](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/releases).*

> ## ArchUnit 0.9.3
> # Bug Fixes
> 
> Fixed memory leak in combination of the newly added `ArchRule.AssertionError` and JUnit 4. JUnit 4 keeps references to all thrown `AssertionErrors` through the whole run. Since `ArchRule.AssertionError` kept a reference to `EvaluationResult` this could consume a lot of memory, if the respective results were big.
> This release removes `ArchRule.AssertionError` (introduced in version 0.9.0).
> 
> Note that this is in theory a **breaking change**, since it would have been possible to catch and process `ArchRule.AssertionError`. There does not seem to be any clean solution to this problem though, and due to the slim probability that the removal of this part of the API will in fact affect any user, the step seems justified.
> 
> If anybody should against all odds have a problem with this, feel free to open an issue and we will find a different solution.

The 'Column width' stuff have been removed and the 'Field name' is now editable. You need to close and reopen the app for the preference changes to take effect.

Edit: It used to be that some files I haven't touched were showing errors, so I can't build the project to see if my changes actually fixed anything. But that's not a problem anymore.

org.jabref.logic.importer.fileformat.EndXmlImporter.java has errors because the entire org.jabref.logic.importer.fileformat.endnote folder is missing.

Potential solution for [#4539](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4539):
- Made ""entrytype"" as a valid keyword for automatically created groups.
- Added check in <code>BibEntry</code> to see if 'searchField' matches TYPE_HEADER - ""entrytype""
- Made change in <code>WordKeywordGroup</code> to collect entries for the entrytype groups
- Screenshots reflecting the change attached -

1) All entries -

I had to remove the code which sets sorting at startup of the columns, that kills the performance.
Mabye it helps to store it directly in the column objects
Will investigate this further.

I found out that JabRef sequentially loads the last edited files in the GUI thread.
Now I decided to load multiple databases in parallel and in a background task.
This drastically improves the startup performance.

This is currently more a good hack. But maybe @tobiasdiez  you have some ideas on how to make it fine.
Seems that I currently are stuck with an open thread at exiting JabRef

- BibTex parser is now triggered on focus out of the text area instead of on value change event to allow the user to remove both opening `{` and closing bracket `}`
- at the end of parse method, if no error has been spot, epilog variable (which contains eventual remaining BibTex fragment ignored by the parser) is now 'regex'-checked to verify if there's still some relevant content in the form `<fieldName> = <content>,`
- if the above check states something relevant has not been parsed then an error is thrown and it is intercepted by `DialogService`. I used `DialogService` since the already in place `NotificationPane` seems not working (however I also left `NotificationPane` to let the reviewer decide what to do)

@tobiasdiez please validate this solution, thanks!

I have added a previewStyle variable to check when the preview style changes.
From my observation, the layout is updated every time tabs are switched or preview styles are cycled through. With the addition of a variable, these 2 situations can be differentiated to print out the notification more appropriately.

Created solution for suggested improvement described in [#4496](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4496)
----

Adjusted BaseDialog class to watch for new KeyBinding combination (default: ctrl + ENTER). When such combination is pressed in any dialog which extends BaseDialog, then system tries to find button with default action. If such button is found, then its event is fired. 

Additional tests were not created as there currently is no BaseDialogTest test suite and existing dialog tests should cover the changes. In my opinion, quite major refactoring should be made to easily create unit tests for BaseDialog class.

3. Confirmations to Mr. DLib when JabRef has received recommendations and when it has displayed them.
4. Mr. DLib production server is now used for all versions of JabRef as the Dev server was too slow for users of the JabRef development snapshot.

User mentioned that after pressing one of the styles and saving it, the style is not updated.
To change the preview style, he has to move the selected style to the right column before pressing ""Save"".

Selecting styles in the right column can be previewed in the test panel. However, the style of bibEntry is not updated after pressing `Test`. To rectify this, the citation style is updated in Preferences.
To ensure preview style configuration is saved, the chosen preview style is also saved in the Preferences.

Note that if preview style (at the left column) is selected, the configuration will not be saved.

Having it as an explicit folder means you don't need to define the desktop option in the yaml, and that the icon and .desktop file are moved automatically to the snap.

I used the builtin version-script to set the version number from the gradle file

The build works, but the snap only works in devmode because it looks for the java preference folders

> <h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
> <p>
> The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of 
> cryptographic algorithms.  The package is organised so that it 
> contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment
> (including the J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
> to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
> </p>
> <h2>2.0 Release History</h2>
> 
> 
> <h3>2.1.1 Version</h3>
> Release: 1.61<br/>
> Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2019, February 4th.
> <h3>2.1.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
> <ul>
> <li>Use of EC named curves could be lost if keys were constructed via a key factory and algorithm parameters. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>RFC3211WrapEngine would not properly handle messages longer than 127 bytes. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>The JCE implementations for RFC3211 would not return null AlgorithmParameters. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>TLS: Don't check CCS status for hello_request.</li>
> <li>TLS: Tolerate unrecognized hash algorithms.</li>
> <li>TLS: Tolerate unrecognized SNI types.</li>
> <li>An incompatibility issue in ECIES-KEM encryption in cofactor mode has been fixed.</li>
> <li>An issue with XMSS/XMSSMT private key loading which could result in invalid signatures has been fixed.</li>
> <li>StateAwareSignature.isSigningCapable() now returns false when the key has reached it's maximum number of signatures.</li>
> <li>The McEliece KeyPairGenerator was failing to initialize the underlying class if a SecureRandom was explicitly passed.</li>
> <li>The McEliece cipher would sometimes report the wrong value on a call to Cipher.getOutputSize(int). This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>CSHAKEDigest.leftEncode() was using the wrong endianness for multi byte values. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>Some ciphers, such as CAST6, were missing AlgorithmParameters implementations. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>An issue with the default ""m"" parameter for 1024 bit Diffie-Hellman keys which could result in an exception on key pair generation has been fixed.</li>
> <li>The SPHINCS256 implementation is now more tolerant of parameters wrapped with a SecureRandom and will not throw an exception if it receives one.</li>
> <li>A regression in PGPUtil.writeFileToLiteralData() which could cause corrupted literal data has been fixed.</li>
> <li>Several parsing issues related to the processing of CMP PKIPublicationInfo have been fixed.</li>
> <li>The ECGOST curves for id-tc26-gost-3410-12-256-paramSetA and id-tc26-gost-3410-12-512-paramSetC had incorrect co-factors. These have been fixed.</li>

- Rework dialog in JavaFX
- Unify code for import (move everything from the old import dialog class to the import handler)
- Simply interface and reduce user-choices (in particular, always generate bibtex keys)

There are still a few todo's related to undo/redo functionality (which is a further huge PR). Moreover, I'm not sure if I correctly transferred the handling of duplicated entries (the code was a bit hard to understand at some places).

@MartinKarim Any suggestions to (further) improve the UI? I tried to highlight the entries which the user selected for import (by clicking the plus icon), but that looked ugly and was in conflict to mouse over and mouse clicked states of the list rows.

Removes the global search feature (i.e. list matched entries across all open libraries). Converting this dialog to JavaFX would mean a huge effort as the maintable would have to be refactored so that one can reuse the GUI-related logic. On the other hand, I guess only a very small fraction of users are actually aware of this feature so it shouldn't be a huge loss (we have no telemetry data for this dialog as it was implemented slightly differently and didn't derived from JabRefDialog).

@JabRef/developers any objections?

I guess I'm in the mood of removing stuff. This time it's the dialog that allowed the user to add (or remove) the selected entry to groups (it was available through the right-click menu). In my opinion, this dialog is completely obsolete as the user can assign entries to groups via the group side pane.

Fixes #4614

Removes the resolve duplicate keys dialog. This feature is made obsolete by the integrity check and the user can generate new keys very simply (for all entries or only for the duplicated ones) through the entry editor and/or menu.

As discussed in the devcall, we might temporarily remove (or disable) some of the old Swing dialog instead of converting them directly to JavaFX. The ""Customize entry types"" dialog is one of these dialogs, because it is not yet clear how entries should be displayed in the entry editor (especially how to group fields) and these decisions directly translate to changes to the customization dialog.

After merging, an issue for the re-implementation should be opened.

Removes the ""plain text import"" dialog. Although I like the idea of the dialog, our users simply do not use it. The azure telemetry shows only 35 interactions with the dialog in the past year. Moreover, the dialog is currently broken (you cannot paste anything) and the git logs suggest that it's in this state now for over a year - but we have no user reports about this. Finally, the re-implementation in JavaFX would be a huge effort, which I'm not will to invest in view of the low usage numbers.

I would suggest to re-implement some of the features (like automatic bibtex generation using freecite) at a later stage.

The issue was, `storeSource()` method is called when entry is out of focus, however, if another entry is selected then `currentEntry` is updated to that and `storeSource()` is called with the previous `codeArea` but updating it in the second entry, thus causing a duplication.

Fix was to pass the entry as another argument to `storeSource()`.

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [archunit-junit5-api's releases](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/releases).*

> ## ArchUnit 0.10.1
> # Bug Fixes
> 
> * `JavaPackage.PackageVisitor` and `JavaPackage.ClassVisitor` are now public instead of package-private to be usable as public API
> 
> ## ArchUnit 0.10.0
> # Breaking Changes
> 
> * The deprecated method `String JavaClass.getPackage()` was replaced by `JavaPackage JavaClass.getPackage()`. To query the package name, please use `String JavaClass.getPackageName()`.
> * The deprecated method `JavaClass.getDirectDependencies()` has been removed -> use `JavaClass.getDirectDependenciesFromSelf()` instead
> * The deprecated field `JavaClass.Functions.SIMPLE_NAME` has been removed, please use `JavaClass.Functions.GET_SIMPLE_NAME`
> 
> # New Deprecation
> 
> * ArchUnit does not use contractions anymore within the rules API. So far many methods were phrased like `dontHave...()` instead of `doNotHave...()`. In general this seems to be more trouble than worth it and does not read that well without an apostrophe, so all those methods were declared deprecated and have a new counter part without the contraction. A simple search & replace of `dont` by `doNot` should fix all those deprecations.
> * Some methods were deprecated because they were not precise enough, if generics come into play. For example `JavaClass JavaField.getType()` is not precise enough, because the type of a field is something else than a `JavaClass` (like `T someField` or `List<? extends T> someField`). Thus all those methods have been deprecated to make room for a future extension with generics and instead got a new version explicitly stating that the ""raw type"" is meant. For example `JavaField.getType()` -> `JavaField.getRawType()`, `JavaMethod.getParameters()` -> `JavaMethod.getRawParameterTypes()`.
> * `Formatters.formatLocation(JavaClass, lineNumber)` was deprecated in favor of the newly introduced `SourceCodeLocation.of(JavaClass, lineNumber)` which will report the correct location (i.e. link for IDEs) via `toString()`
> 
> # Enhancements
> 
> ## Core
> 
> * The default class resolution behavior for classes missing from the import was changed. Before by default missing classes were replaced by stubs, now by default they will be resolved from the classpath. Compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_dealing_with_missing_classes) (see [#111](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/111))
> * `JavaClass` can now be queried for declared throws clauses, any `Throwables` declared on methods or constructors count as dependencies of a `JavaClass` (see [#126](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/126); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;tngwoerleij](https://github.com/tngwoerleij))
> * `JavaClass` can now be queried if it is an array (see [#114](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/114); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;wengertj](https://github.com/wengertj))
> * The resolution of classes from the classpath will now use the context `ClassLoader` if set (should usually not make any difference, but allows to control the `ClassLoader` used by ArchUnit for class resolution)
> * `JavaClass` now has a more sophisticated `JavaPackage` attached to it. It is also possible to retrieve any `JavaPackage` from `JavaClasses`. `JavaPackage` offers a more convenient API for dependencies between packages (see [#158](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/158); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;goetzd](https://github.com/goetzd) for reviewing and user guide adjustment)
> * For arrays `JavaClass.getPackageName()` now returns the package of the component type instead of empty. While empty is closer to the Java Reflection API, it is not really useful from a point of view of dependencies. Using an array of a type in a package should cause a dependency to that package (see [#161](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/161))
> 
> ## Lang
> 
> * The rules API now provides an extensive support for checks of members / methods / fields (see [#38](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/38); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;hankem](https://github.com/hankem) for an extensive review and many improvements)
> 
> ## Library
> 
> * It is now possible to create a `CompositeArchRule` from several `ArchRules` to check multiple rules at once (see [#78](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/78); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;bogsi17](https://github.com/bogsi17))
> * The PlantUML rules API now understands more types of arrows (description on arrows, arrows from right to left, arrow colors), compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_plantuml_component_diagrams_as_rules) (see [#135](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/135))
> * New predefined rule to avoid the use of `org.joda.time` in favor of the `java.time` API (see [#145](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/145); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;sullis](https://github.com/sullis))
> * The slices API is now more configurable to deal with inconsistent package structures and legacy projects. It is now possible to customize the assignment of `JavaClasses` to `Slices` by a simple function `JavaClass` -> `Identifier`, compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_slices) (see [#156](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/156))
> 
> ## JUnit
> 
> * The JUnit 5 platform dependency has been upgraded to version `1.4.0`.
> 
> # Further Acknowledgement
> 
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;alanktwong](https://github.com/alanktwong) for improving the CONTRIBUTING docs on how to build the project
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;wengertj](https://github.com/wengertj) for removing use of deprecated Gradle API
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;olleolleolle](https://github.com/olleolleolle) for replacing the PNG build badge by SVG
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;sullis](https://github.com/sullis) for updating the Travis build to use OpenJDK 11

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [archunit-junit5-engine's releases](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/releases).*

> ## ArchUnit 0.10.1
> # Bug Fixes
> 
> * `JavaPackage.PackageVisitor` and `JavaPackage.ClassVisitor` are now public instead of package-private to be usable as public API
> 
> ## ArchUnit 0.10.0
> # Breaking Changes
> 
> * The deprecated method `String JavaClass.getPackage()` was replaced by `JavaPackage JavaClass.getPackage()`. To query the package name, please use `String JavaClass.getPackageName()`.
> * The deprecated method `JavaClass.getDirectDependencies()` has been removed -> use `JavaClass.getDirectDependenciesFromSelf()` instead
> * The deprecated field `JavaClass.Functions.SIMPLE_NAME` has been removed, please use `JavaClass.Functions.GET_SIMPLE_NAME`
> 
> # New Deprecation
> 
> * ArchUnit does not use contractions anymore within the rules API. So far many methods were phrased like `dontHave...()` instead of `doNotHave...()`. In general this seems to be more trouble than worth it and does not read that well without an apostrophe, so all those methods were declared deprecated and have a new counter part without the contraction. A simple search & replace of `dont` by `doNot` should fix all those deprecations.
> * Some methods were deprecated because they were not precise enough, if generics come into play. For example `JavaClass JavaField.getType()` is not precise enough, because the type of a field is something else than a `JavaClass` (like `T someField` or `List<? extends T> someField`). Thus all those methods have been deprecated to make room for a future extension with generics and instead got a new version explicitly stating that the ""raw type"" is meant. For example `JavaField.getType()` -> `JavaField.getRawType()`, `JavaMethod.getParameters()` -> `JavaMethod.getRawParameterTypes()`.
> * `Formatters.formatLocation(JavaClass, lineNumber)` was deprecated in favor of the newly introduced `SourceCodeLocation.of(JavaClass, lineNumber)` which will report the correct location (i.e. link for IDEs) via `toString()`
> 
> # Enhancements
> 
> ## Core
> 
> * The default class resolution behavior for classes missing from the import was changed. Before by default missing classes were replaced by stubs, now by default they will be resolved from the classpath. Compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_dealing_with_missing_classes) (see [#111](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/111))
> * `JavaClass` can now be queried for declared throws clauses, any `Throwables` declared on methods or constructors count as dependencies of a `JavaClass` (see [#126](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/126); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;tngwoerleij](https://github.com/tngwoerleij))
> * `JavaClass` can now be queried if it is an array (see [#114](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/114); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;wengertj](https://github.com/wengertj))
> * The resolution of classes from the classpath will now use the context `ClassLoader` if set (should usually not make any difference, but allows to control the `ClassLoader` used by ArchUnit for class resolution)
> * `JavaClass` now has a more sophisticated `JavaPackage` attached to it. It is also possible to retrieve any `JavaPackage` from `JavaClasses`. `JavaPackage` offers a more convenient API for dependencies between packages (see [#158](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/158); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;goetzd](https://github.com/goetzd) for reviewing and user guide adjustment)
> * For arrays `JavaClass.getPackageName()` now returns the package of the component type instead of empty. While empty is closer to the Java Reflection API, it is not really useful from a point of view of dependencies. Using an array of a type in a package should cause a dependency to that package (see [#161](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/161))
> 
> ## Lang
> 
> * The rules API now provides an extensive support for checks of members / methods / fields (see [#38](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/38); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;hankem](https://github.com/hankem) for an extensive review and many improvements)
> 
> ## Library
> 
> * It is now possible to create a `CompositeArchRule` from several `ArchRules` to check multiple rules at once (see [#78](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/78); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;bogsi17](https://github.com/bogsi17))
> * The PlantUML rules API now understands more types of arrows (description on arrows, arrows from right to left, arrow colors), compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_plantuml_component_diagrams_as_rules) (see [#135](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/135))
> * New predefined rule to avoid the use of `org.joda.time` in favor of the `java.time` API (see [#145](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/145); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;sullis](https://github.com/sullis))
> * The slices API is now more configurable to deal with inconsistent package structures and legacy projects. It is now possible to customize the assignment of `JavaClasses` to `Slices` by a simple function `JavaClass` -> `Identifier`, compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_slices) (see [#156](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/156))
> 
> ## JUnit
> 
> * The JUnit 5 platform dependency has been upgraded to version `1.4.0`.
> 
> # Further Acknowledgement
> 
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;alanktwong](https://github.com/alanktwong) for improving the CONTRIBUTING docs on how to build the project
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;wengertj](https://github.com/wengertj) for removing use of deprecated Gradle API
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;olleolleolle](https://github.com/olleolleolle) for replacing the PNG build badge by SVG
> * Thanks a lot to [@&#8203;sullis](https://github.com/sullis) for updating the Travis build to use OpenJDK 11

Removes old swing code that was no longer used or that could be deleted after small refactorings. There is still a lot of old dead code left, so this PR is not the last one in this direction.

Fixes issue [#4736](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4736)

Changes:

1. Introduced a new `LaTexFileDirectory` to MetaData.java
2. The path of the aux file is now serialized as a relative path with respect to the `LaTexFileDirectory`
3. The `getFilePath()` of TexGroup now returns the relative path of the aux file used to create the group.
4. Each user can define their own `LaTexFileDirectory` similar to `userFileDirectory`
5. I have implemented tests to check for basic parsing/serialization and also to check that the relative path is being found correctly.
6. When user selects an aux file via the browse button, they are shown the relative path of the file in `texGroupFilePath` in Group Dialog.

The issue was when a user right-clicks an entry and right click ""open folder""  then it results in Null Pointer Exception in Linux System.

The main cause for this issue was in the Linux implementation of NativeDesktop(Linux.java#openFolderAndSelectFile), that code looks for 
an environment variable named 'DESKTOP_SESSION' and if this variable is not set in any system then it will result in Null Pointer Exception.

The Fix was to check if 'DESKTOP_SESSION' variable is present or not, if not present then run a default command which will try to open the folder.

Another issue was that if a system does not have a file browser installed then right-clicking on any entry and selecting ""open folder"" option will not do anything(if there is no file browser installed in the system).

To fix this issue I've added an option in preference setting window to set command or program for default file browser, where a user can explicitly set command or let JefRef use a default behavior like this:

Now the enabling/disabling the OK button with regards to the text fields have been validated properly without changing the logic of the existing code. As @Siedlerchr mentioned now, no need to switch to another radio button and back again to enable the OK button.

Fixes issue [#4679](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4679)

This PR fixes the first issue. I could not reproduce the second issue. The item count should now be updated correctly.

The problem was because of the Listener not getting notified when changes were being made. This was due to the weak listener which was attached to ObservableList returned by `databaseContext.getDatabase().getEntries()`.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44341400/whats-the-purpose-of-fxcollections-unmodifiableobservablelist


The only case where this PR might not work is when we are dealing with a library in which there are no groups other than the All Entries [#4441](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4441). That is because the group being utilized in the line `text.textProperty().bind(group.getHits().asString());` in file /gui/groups/GroupTreeView.java is the group All Entries that is present even before you open any library in JabRef. This causes value to not be set properly. But the only time it happens is if the only group you have in the new library is All Entries. Once we are able to fix that, this PR should work in all cases.

Removed JabRefFrame.output in favor of FXDialogService.notify and refactored calling code.
Added Logging to FXDialogService.notify

Logs seemed to be duplicated afterwards. However, this was another issue with log4j. Because LogEvent-Objects are reused, they were copied in LogMessages.add . But at that point it was too late, resulting in different Log Messages being overwritten. I therefore moved the copying to GuiAppender.append and this resolves the issue of seemingly duplicated log messages. 
This is probably also the reason for [#4811](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4811)

I found the following. During serialization, the group string is quoted twice, once when it is being serialized to the group string in class `org.jabref.logic.exporter.GroupSerializer`, and once when the group string is being combined with other metadata in `org.jabref.logic.exporter.MetaDataSerializer`, hence 2^2 = 4 quotes in the database after saving. It is also unquoted twice, once when the group string is being separated from the metadata string in method `getNextUnit` in class `org.jabref.logic.importer.MetaDataParser`, and again in `org.jabref.logic.importer.GroupParser` in each of the `...fromString` methods using `StringUtil.unquote`. However, it is also unquoted a third time (between the other two) in `QuotedStringTokenizer`. `QuotedStringTokenizer` splits the group into parts, which are then given back to `GroupsParser` and unquoted using `StringUtil.unquote`. The change I made allows `QuotedStringTokenizer` only to split the parts of the group string, rather than also unquoting them.

Fixes #4588

In `FindFullTextAction`, `Task` is now used instead of `BackgroundTask` to be able to show a progress dialog which shows the progress for searching files online.

![lookupDialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24212145/55612578-cabc0800-5788-11e9-92b4-ec4081977b7d.PNG)

Furthermore, the functionality for downloading a file in `LinkedFileViewModel` is split into `download` and `prepareDownloadTask` to be able to define a custom onSucess-action for the background task. This is used in `FindFullTextAction` to add the downloaded file to the entry instead of the URL.

The functionality provided by `LinkedFileViewModel.dowload` remains as it is, so it does not affect the download of a single file via the EntryEditor.

The problem is that changes in other threads produce a ""Not on FX application thread"" exception. This is fixed by adding a wrapper around the list of entries. The wrapper only posts changes in the correct thread, without making a copy of the underlying list - so performance shouldn't be affected.

Fixes #4795. Now, certain actions in the menu and toolbar are only enabled if a database is open and/or entries are selected.
Also moved remaining classes from `gui.actions` to more specific packages.

Fixes #4873

The only problem I now have, I can't reliable detect/prevent dupliacte Strings,
e.g. A User can have a String with label a and content b, and a User can enter a new String a  with content c
The first String would now be overwritten.
@tobiasdiez  Do you have an idea if we can directly prevent the entering of duplicates?

The addAll method simply adds all strings and updates the content, if found. Previously it would always report a duplicate label exception.

Maybe one could check the ID value if it's present or equals.

![CustomEntryTypesImport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/320228/56390395-3ba0fc80-622c-11e9-8c95-5dbee14f60ee.png)

Now
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/320228/56390463-61c69c80-622c-11e9-939c-b757aa95ca07.png)


Implement toString() for entryType classes, otherwise the CheckLIstView does not show the name.

I am currently a bit unhappy with the result lists from the dialog. Maybe someone has a more cleaner solution

```
@asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfas{CustomAuthor2016,
  author    = {CustomAuthor},
  date      = {2016},
  timestamp = {2016.09.04},
  year      = {2016},
}
```

@Comment{jabref-entrytype: asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfas: req[author;year/date] opt[]}

As usual the situation was not as easy as it seemed to be in #4887. I reused now the existing renaming logic for ""renaming to suggested filename"" which performs some more checks like not to overwrite existing files and also takes the ""file directory"" settings into account.

Thus, this should fix the remaining problem mentioned in #4844.

What started as a simple fix for #4923, quickly turned in an almost rewrite of the preview logic. Sorry for the large diff.

The biggest change consists in the introduction of  the `PreviewLayout` interface, with the two implementations based on JabRefs layout mechanism or using citation styles. This made it possible to handle these both cases on equal footing, simplifying much of the logic.

> jsoup changelog
> 
> **** Release 1.12.2 [PENDING]
>   * ...
> 
> **** Release 1.12.1 [2019-May12]
>   * Change: removed deprecated method to disable TLS cert checking Connection.validateTLSCertificates().
> 
>   * Change: some internal methods have been rearranged; if you extended any of the Jsoup internals you may need to make
>     updates.
> 
>   * Improvement: documents now remember their parser, so when later manipulating them, the correct HTML or XML tree
>     builder is reused, as are the parser settings like case preservation.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/769>
> 
>   * Improvement: Jsoup now detects the character set of the input if specified in an XML Declaration, when using the
>     HTML parser. Previously that only happened when the XML parser was specified.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1009>
> 
>   * Improvement: if the document's input character set does not support encoding, flip it to one that does.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1007>
> 
>   * Improvement: if a start tag is missing a > and a new tag is seen with a <, treat that as a new tag. (This differs
>     from the HTML5 spec, which would make at attribute with a name beginning with <, but in practice this impacts too
>     many pages.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/797>
> 
>   * Improvement: performance tweaks when parsing start tags, data, tables.
> 
>   * Improvement: added Element.nextElementSiblings() and Element.previousElementSiblings()
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1054>
> 
>   * Improvement: treat center tags as block tags.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1113>
> 
>   * Improvement: allow forms to be submitted with Content-Type=multipart/form-data without requiring a file upload;
>     automatically set the mime boundary.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1058>
> 
>   * Improvement: Jsoup will now detect if an input file or URL is binary, and will refuse to attempt to parse it, with
>     an IO exception. This prevents runaway processing time and wasted effort creating meaningless parsed DOM trees.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1192>
> 
>   * Bugfix: when using the tag case preserving parsing settings, certain HTML tree building rules where not followed
>     for upper case tags.
>     <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1149>
> 
>   * Bugfix: when converting a Jsoup document to a W3C DOM, if an element is namespaced but not in a defined namespace,
>     set it to the global namespace.

Should I continue along this path, or do we need a different solution?

*Sourced from [tika-core's changelog](https://github.com/apache/tika/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).*

> Release 2.0.0 - ???
>    BREAKING CHANGES in 2.0.0
> 
>    * Remove deprecated Metadata keys/properties (TIKA-1974).
> 
>    Other changes
> 
> 
> Release 1.21 - ????
> 
>    * Add optional AUTO mode to OCR'ing of PDFs.  If tesseract is installed
>      and on the path, and this option is selected programmatically
>      or via TikaConfig(), the PDFParser will use heuristics to decide
>      whether or not to run OCR per page on PDFs. (TIKA-2749)
> 
>    * The ZipContainerDetector's default behavior was changed to run
>      streaming detection up to its markLimit.  Users can get the
>      legacy behavior (spool-to-file/rely-on-underlying-file-in-TikaInputStream)
>      by setting markLimit=-1. The POIFSContainerDetector requires an underlying file;
>      it will try to spool the file to disk; if the file's length is > markLimit,
>      it will not attempt detection; set markLimit to -1 for legacy behavior (TIKA-2849).
> 
>    * Upgrade PDFBox to 2.0.14 (TIKA-2834).
> 
>    * Add CSV detection and replace TXTParser with TextAndCSVParser;
>      users can turn off CSV detection by excluding the TextAndCSVParser
>      and adding back the TXTParser via tika-config (TIKA-2833).
> 
>    * Add a CSVParser.  CSV detection is currently based solely on filename
>      and/or information conveyed via Metadata (TIKA-2826).
> 
>    * General upgrades: asm, bouncycastle, commons-codec, commons-lang3, cxf,
>      guava, h2, httpcomponents, jackcess, junrar, Lucene, mime4j, opennlp, parso,
>      sqlite-jdbc (provided), zstd-jni (provided) (TIKA-2824)
> 
>    * Bundle xerces2 with tika-parsers (TIKA-2802).
> 
>    * Upgrade jaxb to 2.3.2 (TIKA-2819).
> 
>    * Upgrade jackson to 2.9.8 (TIKA-2717).
> 
>    * Update tika-eval's common tokens lists (TIKA-2822).
> 
>    * Handle bad tags in tika-eval more robustly (TIKA-2810).
> 
>    * Add reports for tags in tika-eval (TIKA-2809).
> 
>    * Extract text from SDT element within textboxes in .docx files (TIKA-2807).
> 
>    * Try to handle truncated OOXML files more robustly (TIKA-2765).

There were some pull-request in the past, trying to fix this, but they all were forgotten undone. So this is my shot, trying to implement a very simple way to change the push-application.

fixes #674 closes #3942 and closes #4368 closes #5024

~~(Apparently, I forgot the fetch before I opened the new branch. Please ignore the old superfluous commits, my changes start with [95f8668](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/4991/commits/95f86688d18e9081a890b9a0f920e65e72168b3f)~~

~~Attention: It's still WIP,  it's not done yet.
The caption of the menu is temporary, there is no l10n, Toolbarbutton is not updated and another small Problem is left, i could not figure out yet and I am hoping for your support: I was not able to change the caption of the PushAppplicationMenuItem, since it's bound somehow to another variable. Do you have any Idea, how i can change this label?~~

In my opinion this is an ugly hack but still the only option without violating our architecture.
Problem is that the autocompleter has an input binding which is triggered whenever setField in BibEntry is called, in this case part of the apply save actions.
On autosave we have a Background thread in the BackupoManager which executes the saveDatabaseAction which itself executes the save actions.

Exectuted in a background thread:

A request came in to have the entry editor provide a warning when the BibTeX key field is empty. In order to make the warning icon appear, 2 changes were necessary.

**1 - Added new key value pair to multi map in FieldCheckers:** To check for a valid BibTex key in the entry editor, the FieldCheckers object had the following key - value pair in its multimap

( FieldName.KEY, ValidBibtexKeyChecker object ), where FieldName.KEY is the string ""key"".

When the BibtexKeyEditorViewModel tries to actually run this check, they key it provides to the FieldCheckers instance is BibEntry.KEY_FIELD (""bibtexkey"") instead of FieldName.KEY (""key""). To accommodate for this, BibEntry.KEY_FIELD was added to the FieldCheckers multimap.


**2 - Added null and empty string check in ValidBibtexKeyChecker.checkValue():** Fixing the first issue caused an error to come arise in BibtexKeyGenerator.cleanKey() when called by ValidBibtexKeyChecker.checkValue(). This error was due to null strings being fed into BibtexKeyGenerator.cleanKey(). To fix this, a check for null or zero length strings was added. This check also returned the ""empty BibTex key"" message.


**Note:** an issue with the fix is that while it does create the ""empty BibTeX key"" warning, the ""Invalid BibTeX key"" warning is pushed down. Pictures of this issue are attached.

I understood that in the future JabRefPreference probably need Properties, to make them bindable. But for now I think this goes beyond this PR.

It works as expected. I took the liberty, to add a split-pane between the conents and the tabList to enable the user to change the width between them, so this PR is not just about refactoring the Dialog. ;-)

This is very early shot on this matter. I don't know if you think it's worth moving on with this and to look also into the tabs.

As asked, the character '-' was included on the error message, also we included other characters that were not being mentioned on the message. We tried to remove the character '-' from KEY_ILLEGAL_CHARACTERS and KEY_UNWANTED_CHARACTERS on BibtexKeyGenerator.java, but we did not know if it would be a good idea because it violates some tests.
About the order of the tabs, we removed the alphabetical ordering so now it is following the order defined when the tabs are created on the ""Set up general fields"" option.

One odd thing I noticed and this refs probably #4461  is that whenever I paste an entry in the shared database it gets duplicated multiple time. 
This looks oddly familiar. I remember that this was having to do with the subscribers and the event bus system.

The problem is that the Maintable findentry() method does not find the new entry.
Further debugging showed that the Observable List with the entries in the maintable model does not yet include the new inserted entry, although it's already in the bib database.
This is because due to the Bindings.forUI around the list in MainTable, it's run on the FX thread. And the FX thread is blocked/busy with the findEntry method.

I know this was added because of not on fx thread exceptions. But I tested cleanup and external modification of file and it was fine. I think the key problem was the old swing stuff at that time.

This pull resquest fixes issue [#4816](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4816).

When importing RIS files Jabref checks for date fields (Y1,PY,DA and Y2) and uses the first one it finds. The problem is that Y2 refers to access date, DA in most cases is a generic date, and PY is the publication year(reliable field)*. 
https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/40600b35420e688ee5d5758224717b484ad34f84/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fileformat/RisImporter.java#L196-L203
We couldn't find references to Y1('primary date'?). However, as already cited in [#4816](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4816), and by doing some exports we found Y1 to be  PY's synonym, furthermore, when PY received a higher priority than Y1, some tests cases didn't pass as there were a missing month field in .bib.  

We established a priority system indicated by the dateTags (lowest index higher priority)

https://github.com/VMichelan/jabref/blob/2f243c16f08f2cfeba6f1ab4651970d90eb55546/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fileformat/RisImporter.java#L31

We added 2 test cases for this and changed one of the old ones adding the month field.

<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [applicationinsights-logging-log4j2's releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/releases).*

> ## Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0
> This introduces Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0. This adds all the functionality introduced in 2.4.0-BETA and some additional bug fixes and enhancements.
> 
> ## Important Note: Spring Boot Starter Version
> Previously, the Spring Boot Starter had an independent version number, causing some confusion. Future versions the Spring Boot Starter version will track with the SDK version. There will not be a Spring Boot Starter version 1.2.0, and in it's place version 2.4.0.
> 
> ## Changes introduced in 2.4.0-BETA
> The changes to `WebTelemetryModule` in 2.4.0-BETA were reverted back the state in 2.3.1.
> 
> ## Enhancements
> 1. Added retries to CDSProfileFetcher [#901](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/901)
> 2. Added caching of sdk version id, reducing number of file IO operations [#896](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/896)
> 
> ## Bug Fixes
> 1. Fix [#907](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/907) - Ensures string compare is case insensitive when running a SQL explain on a select statement.
> 2. Fixed ThreadLocal leak [#887](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/887)
> 3. Fixed QuickPulse schema version [#904](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/904)
> 4. Fix [#919](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/919) - Fixed issue when adding duplicate Windows performance counter.
> 5. Misc stability improvements [#932](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/932), [#941](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/941), [#945](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/945), [#946](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/946), [#947](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/947), [#948](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/948)
> 
> ## Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0-BETA
> Welcome to Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0-BETA and SpringBoot Starter 1.2.0-BETA. This version introduces several enhancement and bug fixes. 
> 
> ## Removed and Deprecated
> 1. Removed support for multiple apps instrumented with single JVM Agent. Instrumentation will only work for single apps in application server.
> 2. Deprecated class `ApplicationInsightsHttpResponseWrapper.java`
> 
> ### Breaking change
> 1. `WebRequestTelemetry` interface now has another method `setRequestTelemetryContext`. This is needed to propagate context explicitly in asynchronous environments. This change is likely to break clients relying on implementation of this interface in their code.
> 
> ## Enhancements
> 1. Introduced beta support for manual context propagation in Async and Explicit Multithreading scenarios. 
> Please refer to this wiki (https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/wiki/Distributed-Tracing-in-Asynchronous-Java-Applications) for instructions.
> 2. [#444](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/444) Introduced support to capture asynchronous request.
> 3. [#749](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/749) Introduce beta supported instrumentation for Postgres SQL jdbc4 driver prepared statements via JVM Agent.
> 4. Introduced experimental API's AIHttpServletListener, HttpServerHandler, ApplicationInsightsServletExtractor and HttpExtractor.
> 5. Introduced `WebTelemetryModule.setRequestTelemetryContext` API.
> 6. [#797](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/797) SDKLogger can now be enabled using system properties.
> 
> ## Bug Fixes
> 1. [#879](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/879) Fixed issue with request/dependency correlation
> 2. Fixed [#826](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/826) Remove duplicate Postgres provider.
> 3. [#881](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/881) Fix SDK version in QuickPulse Telemetry.
> 4. [#883](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/883) Fixed dependency metric collection for QuickPulse/LiveMetrics
> 5. [#852](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/852) Fixed bug in `PreparedStatementVisitor` to instrument all overloads of `setTimestamp`.
> 6.

> ## Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0
> This introduces Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0. This adds all the functionality introduced in 2.4.0-BETA and some additional bug fixes and enhancements.
> 
> ## Important Note: Spring Boot Starter Version
> Previously, the Spring Boot Starter had an independent version number, causing some confusion. Future versions the Spring Boot Starter version will track with the SDK version. There will not be a Spring Boot Starter version 1.2.0, and in it's place version 2.4.0.
> 
> ## Changes introduced in 2.4.0-BETA
> The changes to `WebTelemetryModule` in 2.4.0-BETA were reverted back the state in 2.3.1.
> 
> ## Enhancements
> 1. Added retries to CDSProfileFetcher [#901](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/901)
> 2. Added caching of sdk version id, reducing number of file IO operations [#896](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/896)
> 
> ## Bug Fixes
> 1. Fix [#907](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/907) - Ensures string compare is case insensitive when running a SQL explain on a select statement.
> 2. Fixed ThreadLocal leak [#887](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/887)
> 3. Fixed QuickPulse schema version [#904](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/pull/904)
> 4. Fix [#919](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/919) - Fixed issue when adding duplicate Windows performance counter.
> 5.

> 
> ## Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0-BETA
> Welcome to Application Insights Java SDK 2.4.0-BETA and SpringBoot Starter 1.2.0-BETA. This version introduces several enhancement and bug fixes. 
> 
> ## Removed and Deprecated
> 1. Removed support for multiple apps instrumented with single JVM Agent. Instrumentation will only work for single apps in application server.
> 2. Deprecated class `ApplicationInsightsHttpResponseWrapper.java`
> 
> ### Breaking change
> 1. `WebRequestTelemetry` interface now has another method `setRequestTelemetryContext`. This is needed to propagate context explicitly in asynchronous environments. This change is likely to break clients relying on implementation of this interface in their code.
> 
> ## Enhancements
> 1. Introduced beta support for manual context propagation in Async and Explicit Multithreading scenarios. 
> Please refer to this wiki (https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/wiki/Distributed-Tracing-in-Asynchronous-Java-Applications) for instructions.
> 2. [#444](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/444) Introduced support to capture asynchronous request.
> 3. [#749](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/749) Introduce beta supported instrumentation for Postgres SQL jdbc4 driver prepared statements via JVM Agent.
> 4. Introduced experimental API's AIHttpServletListener, HttpServerHandler, ApplicationInsightsServletExtractor and HttpExtractor.
> 5. Introduced `WebTelemetryModule.setRequestTelemetryContext` API.
> 6. [#797](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/797) SDKLogger can now be enabled using system properties.
> 
> ## Bug Fixes
> 1. [#879](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/879) Fixed issue with request/dependency correlation
> 2. Fixed [#826](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/826) Remove duplicate Postgres provider.
> 3. [#881](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/881) Fix SDK version in QuickPulse Telemetry.
> 4. [#883](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/883) Fixed dependency metric collection for QuickPulse/LiveMetrics
> 5. [#852](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/852) Fixed bug in `PreparedStatementVisitor` to instrument all overloads of `setTimestamp`.

This is a huge refactor PR. I'm sorry for its size, but I couldn't break it down into smaller pieces. The changes are as follows:
- Introduce extended enum `Field` for fields (e.g `StandardField.AUTHOR` instead of the string ""author"") and use this everywhere. Besides the name of the field, some basic and universal properties are stored (e.g. whether it is a numeric field)
- Introduce the class `BibField` which enriches the `Field` by properties that depend on the entry (type) where this field is used. Right now this is only how important the field is (which should in the long term replace the required/optional dichometry.  
- Introduce extended enum `EntryType` for entry types (e.g. `StandardEntryType.ARTICLE` instead of the string ""article"") and use this everywhere. 
- Introduce the class `BibEntryType` that enriches an `EntryType` by properties that the user can configure (e.g. required fields).

I tried to not change any behavior, except the following things that I noticed while testing:
- All fields are now properly sorted alphabetically (in the subgroups of required/optional fields) when the entry is written to the bib file.
- Some importers used the field `pubstatus` instead of the standard BibTeX field `pubstate`.

The new tab **can be disabled** in the preferences.

---

## Summary of changes

### An improved back-end
- Optimized parsing performance
- Non-existing nested files are skipped
- Better exception handling

### The new tab
- New tab in the entry editor: _LaTeX Citations_
- This tab could be disabled in the entry editor preferences
- A progress indicator appears while parsing
- Search cancellation if the active entry is changed (background tasks)
- Parsed files are stored when the tool is run for the first time (much better performance)
- The current search path is shown at the bottom, next to a button to change the LaTeX file directory
- Error logging and handling (some of them are shown in the entry editor)

### A custom user interface controller for listing citations
- Citations list view is the same for dialog tool and tab (`CitationsDisplay`)
- Context of citations, instead of the full line (which is shown as a tooltip)
- Changed absolute file path to a relative one, from the search path
- New icons and styles for context, file path and position (line and column) of a citation

### Miscellaneous
- Updated `EntryEditor` class for injecting dependencies and fixing minor bugs
- Renamed tool: _LaTeX Citations_ instead of _LaTeX references_

> Release 2.0.0 - ???
>    BREAKING CHANGES in 2.0.0
> 
>    * Remove deprecated Metadata keys/properties (TIKA-1974).
> 
>    Other changes
> 
> Release 1.22 - ???
> 
>    * NOTE: Known regression: PDFBOX-4587 -- PDF passwords with codepoints

> 
>    * Add parser for HWP v5 files via SooMyung Lee (soomyung) and

> 
>    * Fix order of closing streams to avoid ""Failed to close temporary resource""

> 
>    * Improve AutoDetectReader performance by caching encoding

>    * Prevent RTFParser from outputting illegal tag combinations (TIKA-2889).
> 
>    * Fix RereadableInputStream to release all resources (TIKA-2903).
> 
>    * Implement custom language identifier in the tika-eval module based on

> 
> Release 1.21 - 05/14/2019

>    * Add optional AUTO mode to OCR'ing of PDFs.  If tesseract is installed
>      and on the path, and this option is selected programmatically
>      or via TikaConfig(), the PDFParser will use heuristics to decide
>      whether or not to run OCR per page on PDFs. (TIKA-2749)

>    * The ZipContainerDetector's default behavior was changed to run
>      streaming detection up to its markLimit.  Users can get the
>      legacy behavior (spool-to-file/rely-on-underlying-file-in-TikaInputStream)

fixes #5164 #4752 #3354 #4459

This is going to be a huge one. I already put some work into, but I need to take a little break, So I present an early WIP of the reworked TableColumsTab in the Preferences. There are some issues in sight, eg. the checkModel is sime kind of special.

I realized, there is maybe something wrong with the serializeSpecialFields-Option. I was not able to find any use for this pref in the whole code.

Im trying not to break anything, so besides the conversion I will not change the logic of what is controlled here. I'll leave that to another person, after im done here. My goal is to include all the specialFields and the FileFields in the ~CheckListView~, where you can sort, activate, deactivate, add custom fields (so called 'UnknownField') and remove them as you like.

Feel free to comment on it, give suggestions and ideas.

Update: We did some conceptual changes. See below.

One of my groupcolors is white, which made it hard to see in the jabref window.
I added a thin grey border, so one can see even white groups on white background.
Also I made the area, the user can put his mousepointer in to show the tooltip, a little wider (3 pixels were to small)

> ## Core
> 
> * `DescribedPredicate` now offers a more lambda compatible factory method `DescribedPredicate.describe(description, predicate)` (see [#188](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/188); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;jzheaux](https://github.com/jzheaux))
> * New factory method `DescribedPredicate.allElements(..)` to complement `DescribedPredicate.anyElementThat(..)` (see https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/commit/b8890f447c3621cb16cb21e636b2a5397722c9ec)
> * Support for JDK 13 (see [#195](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/195); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;jqno](https://github.com/jqno))
> * ArchUnits configuration (`archunit.properties`) and ignore patterns (`archunit_ignore_patterns.txt`) are now loaded with the `ContextClassLoader` instead of the `ClassLoader` of the respective class (see https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/commit/81c31f6b7ffd9c4836e1f8a0303724eb7f05ce83)
>

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [error_prone_core's releases](https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases).*

> ## Error Prone 2.3.3
> ## New checks:
> 
> * [`AssignmentToMock`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AssignmentToMock): Fields annotated with [@&#8203;Mock](https://github.com/Mock) should not be manually assigned to.
> * [`AutoValueImmutableFields`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AutoValueImmutableFields): AutoValue recommends using immutable collections
> * [`CompareToZero`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/CompareToZero): The result of #compareTo or #compare should only be compared to 0. It is an implementation detail whether a given type returns strictly the values {-1, 0, +1} or others.
> * [`DeduplicateConstants`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DeduplicateConstants): This expression was previously declared as a constant; consider replacing this occurrence.
> * [`DiscardedPostfixExpression`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DiscardedPostfixExpression): The result of this unary operation on a lambda parameter is discarded
> * [`DuplicateMapKeys`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DuplicateMapKeys): Map#ofEntries will throw an IllegalArgumentException if there are any duplicate keys
> * [`EscapedEntity`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/EscapedEntity): HTML entities in @code/[@&#8203;literal](https://github.com/literal) tags will appear literally in the rendered javadoc.
> * [`InheritDoc`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/InheritDoc): Invalid use of [@&#8203;inheritDoc](https://github.com/inheritDoc).
> * [`InterfaceWithOnlyStatics`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/InterfaceWithOnlyStatics): This interface only contains static fields and methods; consider making it a final class instead to prevent subclassing.
> * [`InvalidBlockTag`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/InvalidBlockTag): This tag is invalid.
> * [`InvalidInlineTag`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/InvalidInlineTag): This tag is invalid.
> * [`MissingSummary`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MissingSummary): A summary line is required on public/protected Javadocs.
> * [`MixedDescriptors`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MixedDescriptors): The field number passed into #getFieldByNumber belongs to a different proto to the Descriptor.
> * [`MixedMutabilityReturnType`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MixedMutabilityReturnType): This method returns both mutable and immutable collections or maps from different paths. This may be confusing for users of the method.
> * [`MockitoInternalUsage`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MockitoInternalUsage): org.mockito.internal.* is a private API and should not be used by clients
> * [`OptionalMapToOptional`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/OptionalMapToOptional): Mapping to another Optional will yield a nested Optional. Did you mean flatMap?
> * [`OutlineNone`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/OutlineNone): Setting CSS outline style to none or 0 (while not otherwise providing visual focus indicators) is inaccessible for users navigating a web page without a mouse.
> * [`PreconditionsCheckNotNullRepeated`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/PreconditionsCheckNotNullRepeated): Including the first argument of checkNotNull in the failure message is not useful, as it will always be `null`.
> * [`RedundantOverride`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/RedundantOverride): This override is redundant, and can be removed.
> * [`RefersToDaggerCodegen`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/RefersToDaggerCodegen): Don't refer to Dagger's internal or generated code
> * [`RxReturnValueIgnored`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/RxReturnValueIgnored): Returned Rx objects must be checked. Ignoring a returned Rx value means it is never scheduled for execution
> * [`TreeToString`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TreeToString): Tree#toString shouldn't be used for Trees deriving from the code being compiled, as it discards whitespace and comments.
> * [`TypeEquals`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TypeEquals): com.sun.tools.javac.code.Type doesn't override Object.equals and instances are not interned by javac, so testing types for equality should be done with Types#isSameType instead
> * [`UnescapedEntity`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/UnescapedEntity): Javadoc is interpreted as HTML, so HTML entities such as &, <, > must be escaped.
> * [`UnusedMethod`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/UnusedMethod): Unused.
> * [`UnusedNestedClass`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/UnusedNestedClass): This nested class is unused, and can be removed.
> * [`UnusedVariable`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/UnusedVariable): Unused.
> 
> ## New date and time related checks:
> 
> * [`JavaDurationGetSecondsGetNano`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JavaDurationGetSecondsGetNano): duration.getNano() only accesses the underlying nanosecond adjustment from the whole second.
> * [`JavaDurationWithNanos`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JavaDurationWithNanos): Use of java.time.Duration.withNanos(int) is not allowed.
> * [`JavaDurationWithSeconds`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JavaDurationWithSeconds): Use of java.time.Duration.withSeconds(long) is not allowed.
> * [`JavaInstantGetSecondsGetNano`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JavaInstantGetSecondsGetNano): instant.getNano() only accesses the underlying nanosecond adjustment from the whole second.
> * [`JavaTimeDefaultTimeZone`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JavaTimeDefaultTimeZone): java.time APIs that silently use the default system time-zone are not allowed.
> * [`JodaDurationConstructor`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaDurationConstructor): Use of new Duration(long) is not allowed. Please use Duration.millis(long) instead.
> * [`JodaDurationWithMillis`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaDurationWithMillis): Use of duration.withMillis(long) is not allowed. Please use Duration.millis(long) instead.
> * [`JodaInstantWithMillis`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaInstantWithMillis): Use of instant.withMillis(long) is not allowed. Please use new Instant(long) instead.
> * [`JodaNewPeriod`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaNewPeriod): This may have surprising semantics, e.g. new Period(LocalDate.parse(""1970-01-01""), LocalDate.parse(""1970-02-02"")).getDays() == 1, not 32.
> * [`JodaPlusMinusLong`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaPlusMinusLong): Use of JodaTime's type.plus(long) or type.minus(long) is not allowed (where <type> = {Duration,Instant,DateTime,DateMidnight}). Please use  type.plus(Duration.millis(long)) or type.minus(Duration.millis(long)) instead.
> * [`JodaTimeConverterManager`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaTimeConverterManager): Joda-Time's ConverterManager makes the semantics of DateTime/Instant/etc construction subject to global static state. If you need to define your own converters, use a helper.
> * [`JodaToSelf`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaToSelf): Use of Joda-Time's DateTime.toDateTime(), Duration.toDuration(), Instant.toInstant(), Interval.toInterval(), and Period.toPeriod() are not allowed.
> * [`JodaWithDurationAddedLong`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JodaWithDurationAddedLong): Use of JodaTime's type.withDurationAdded(long, int) (where <type> = {Duration,Instant,DateTime}). Please use type.withDurationAdded(Duration.millis(long), int) instead.
> * [`TemporalAccessorGetChronoField`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TemporalAccessorGetChronoField): TemporalAccessor.get() only works for certain values of ChronoField.
> * [`TimeUnitConversionChecker`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TimeUnitConversionChecker): This TimeUnit conversion looks buggy: converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (and passing a constant), converting to/from the same TimeUnit, or converting TimeUnits where the result is statically known to be 0 or 1 are all buggy patterns.
> * [`DurationFrom`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DurationFrom): Duration.from(Duration) returns itself; from(Period) throws a runtime exception.
> * [`DurationGetTemporalUnit`](http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DurationGetTemporalUnit): Duration.get() only works with SECONDS or NANOS.

1. Add the following compiler arguments for the `JabRef.main` module:
```
--patch-module test=fastparse_2.12-1.0.0.jar --patch-module test2=fastparse-utils_2.12-1.0.0.jar --patch-module test3=sourcecode_2.12-0.1.4.jar --add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control=org.jabref --add-exports org.controlsfx.controls/impl.org.controlsfx.skin=org.jabref --add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene.traversal=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control.behavior=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control.inputmap=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.event=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.collections=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.runtime=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.web/com.sun.webkit=org.controlsfx.controls --add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=org.controlsfx.controls --patch-module org.jabref=build\resources\main
```
2. Switch to Java 11 jdk
3. Select ""Intellj IDEA"" in Settings > Build Tools > Gradle > ""Build and run using"" and ""Run tests using""
4. Use the provided run configuration.

Only problem is that I had to disable the error prone plugin. However, I would say that it is more important to have a simple compilation than this code checker.

Refactoring of the code for managing icons. Now all usages of `de.jensd.fx.glyphs` or `de.jensd.fx.glyphs.materialdesignicons` are encapsulated in the package `gui.icon`.
In there, the usage of `de.jensd.fx.glyphs.materialdesignicons.utils.MaterialDesignIconFactory` is avoided, because of the error described in the issue.

### What this PR adds?
This PR is related to [koppor#343](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/343).

I added a field formatter called **Shorten DOI** formatter which shortens DOI using http://shortdoi.org service. You run the formatter from _Cleanup entries dialog_ by adding it to _Run field formatter_ list.

It looks to work fine. It enables one way conversion from DOI to short DOI.

### Implementation details:
I assumed that short DOI is still a legal DOI. That's why I adjusted the DOI class to work with short DOIs.

### Feedback wanted
I I'd like to ask for your feedback about the code at this stage.

### Next step
- Add a more accessible UI - a toggle button next to the DOI field _shortened/long version_ (This was suggested by @koppor)

This will require adding opposite conversion (from short DOI to DOI). As http://shortdoi.org servcie doesn't offer such a feature I see two approaches:

1. Store the original DOI during the conversion for further back conversion.
**Drawback:** You may not convert from short DOI to DOI if you haven't done the opposite conversion for at least one time.
2. Try to obtain DOI from short DOI using https://doi.org service as it is possible by catching the HTTP redirection

I find the 1st approach fine. The 2th approach is not really good as we are not using any public API and this can stop working in the future.

What do you think folks? :)

### Important
If you would like to checkout this branch and test locally please use [shortdoi-workaround](https://github.com/dawidowoc/jabref/tree/shortdoi-workaround) branch which uses workaround by @r0light for issue [#5245](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5245). On master branch there is an issue with accessing _General tab_ in bibentry editor.

Fixes #5278 
There were a few more not allowed access from within the `com.jfoenix` dependency. But adding the lines with further jvm options from this pull request to the `build.gradle` in the `run` task prevents the Exceptions.
Is this the proper way to adress this or is there a better way to fix such issues?

After a lot of googling I found some old forum thread in the deep of the open office forums which combined gave the solution.

1. Use sockets instead of pipes (cause jpipe is a dll/lib in the LO dir and cannot be found at class loading
2.  Pass an URL ClassLoader as parent to the Bootstrap method.

Fixes [#5109 ](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5109)

Furthermore, the threading issue part of #4958 is fixed by using `UiThreadStringProperty`

New classes are added to `gui.util.uithreadaware` which enable a wrapper class around `ObservableList` which ensures that changes are propagated on the JavaFX Application thread.

I started with `UiThreadListDecorator`, but others like `UiThreadMapDecorator` could be implemented similarly.

Use Github actions and jpackager for deployment. Rip circleci ❤️ . Rip install4j❤️

The following files are created and deployed to builds.jabref.org (and as github artifacts):
- for Windows: JabRef-5.0.0.msi (installer) and JabRef-portable-windows.zip (unzip & run)
- for Linux: jabRef-5.0.0-1_amd64.deb & jabRef-5.0.0-1_x64.rpm (packages) and JabRef-portable-linux.tar.gz (untar & run)
- for MacOS: JabRef-5.0-dev.dmg & JabRef-5.0-dev.pck (packages) and JabRef-portable-macos.tar.gz (untar & run) 

Thus, we can provide an installer (or package) as well as a runable version for each OS.

The log4j appenders were not found. With the help of the log4j people, this could be fixed by upgrading to the latest builds of log4j version 3, see discussion at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2690. I feel somewhat uncomfortable using snapshot builds for our release, but I guess we have no real choice here (at the moment the logger doesn't work at all). Concerning the stability, I was informed that
> The quality of it should be just as good as 2.x, but one of the goals was to modularize it as much as possible. That work hasn't been completed. I also can't guarantee we won't change more stuff before it is released.

I pinned the log4j snapshots to today's version. In this way, we don't have to constantly change our code if they plan to do bigger refactorings on their side. We can always upgrade to a latter snapshot if we should discover a bug in the future.

This PR ha grown pretty huge too, although there is nothing really complicated in it. The four very simple tabs are converted and I included some suggestions about templates/generics and icons @tobiasdiez made in [#5185 comment](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5185#discussion_r322013878) and in [#5265](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5265#discussion_r320335661).

The SaveOrderConfigDisplay had to be refactored, as there were some bugs: It did not want to set the values after resetting the preferences and it could not load the fields-class (crazy java9-module-stuff), so I also had to change some exports in the modules-info. There I also included some changes out of the gitter-discussion.

I already got some ideas how to resort all the preferences and options in the options-menu, One could change the ListView on the sidePane to a TreeView and start thinning each tab into small preferenceTabs. The help buttons could also be somehow adjusted for each tab at the same position. (maybe somewhere to the right of the title)

I guess there are some things to be discussed or corected in this PR, so im looking forward for your comments.

> <h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
> <p>
> The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of 
> cryptographic algorithms.  The package is organised so that it 
> contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment
> (including the J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
> to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
> </p>
> <h2>2.0 Release History</h2>
> 
> <h3>2.1.1 Version</h3>
> Release: 1.63<br/>
> Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2019, September 10th.
> <h3>2.1.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
> <ul>
> <li>The ASN.1 parser would throw a large object exception for some objects which could be safely parsed. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>GOST3412-2015 CTR mode was unusable at the JCE level. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>The DSTU MACs were failing to reset fully on doFinal(). This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>The DSTU MACs would throw an exception if the key was a multiple of the size as the MAC's underlying buffer size. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>EdEC and QTESLA were not previously usable with the post Java 9 module structure. This is now fixed.
> <li>ECNR was not correctly bounds checking the input and could produce invalid signatures. This is now fixed.</li>
> <li>ASN.1: Enforce no leading zeroes in OID branches (longer than 1 character).</li>
> <li>TLS: Fix X448 support in JcaTlsCrypto.</li>
> <li>Fixed field reduction for secp128r1 custom curve.</li>
> <li>Fixed unsigned multiplications in X448 field squaring.</li>
> <li>Some issues over subset Name Constraint validation in the CertPath analyser have now been fixed.</li>
> <li>TimeStampResponse.getEncoded() could throw an exception if the TimeStampToken was null. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>Unnecessary memory usage in the ARGON2 implementation has been removed.</li>
> <li>Param-Z in the GOST-28147 algorithm was not resolving correctly. This has been fixed.</li>
> <li>It is now possible to specify different S-Box parameters for the GOST 28147-89 MAC.</li>
> </ul>
> 
> <h3>2.1.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
> <ul>
> <li>QTESLA is now updated with the round 2 changes. Note: the security catergories, and in some cases key generation and signatures, have changed. For people interested in comparison, the round 1 version is now moved to org.bouncycastle.pqc.crypto.qteslarnd1 - this package will be deleted in 1.64. Please keep in mind that QTESLA may continue to evolve.</li>
> <li>Support has been added for generating Ed25519/Ed448 signed certificates.</li>

It also uses the new snapcraft syntax to assign the version and the gnome base
I've been using it to test it on my system, and it seems to work.
The reduction in size is from 391MB to 237MB.
It did need more tweaks in the plugin, so before merging I'd like to hear from the snapcraf team if the change might be accepted upstream.
If not there might be another change we can do in the snapcraft.yaml file, to avoid changing the plugin

As we are not providing a JabRef library, we don't need to export anything. This should also resolve all these warnings shown in the IDE.

Use JavaFX binding instead of a listener to update the global state manager. That seems to work more reliable and fixes a bunch of issues. In particular, fixes #3142  and fixes #4441.

Moreover, I fixed an error that was thrown when interacting with the toolbar (missing open statement but we were using reflection...).

The problem was that `getTreeTableRow.getItem()` in `ViewModelTreeTableCellFactory` still returned the old item (and not the new one passed as method argument to `updateItem`).

 Since I was already looking at the code, this PR also fixes #3112 that improves the coloring after an entry was added to the group. Also fixes #2857 (at least I couldn't replicate it anymore).

Pt 2: Right click option in maintable: 
Additionally store content also in String format that can be accessed then with simple text editors.

Pt 3: improve also functionality in ""Export to clipboard"" dialog
Currently all ""exporters"" are used for ""Export to Clipboard"" - however, the ones which are creating files like PDFs cannot be used for copying to clipboard - thus they are filtered out now. Additionally, in case RTF or HTML content is exported the specific ClipboardContent has been used.

> ## Application Insights Java SDK 2.5.0
> Announcing Application Insights Java SDK 2.5.0!
> 
> There were no changes since 2.5.0-BETA.5.
> 
> # Summary of Changes Since 2.4.x
> ## Enhancements
> ### SDK-wide
> - Added Java 9/10/11/12 support
> - Introduced new jar, `applicationinsights-web-auto.jar`, which automatically registers the web filter. No need to modify `web.xml` or add `@WebFilter`.
> - Simplifies role name configuration by adding `<RoleName>` tag in `ApplicationInsights.xml`.
> 
> ### New Agent Features
> - Generic JDBC driver support: captures JDBC queries for all JDBC drivers.
> - Automatically captures dependencies for async requests by tracking the request across multiple threads.
> - Agent now captures application logging from Log4j 2/1.2 and Logback.
>    * This removes the need to add the `applicationinsights-logging-*.jar` dependency and modify the application's logging configuration.
> - Improved HTTP client support:
>    * `java.net.HttpURLConnection`
>    * Apache HttpClient 3.x
>    * OkHttp3
>    * OkHttp2 now supports distributed tracing
> - Sets `Operation Name` automatically based on Spring `@RequestMapping`, JAX-RS `@Path` and Struts action class/method name.
>    * This removes the need for `RequestNameHandlerInterceptorAdapter` or other interceptors.
> - Agent now supports multiple applications deployed in the same application server (temporarily in the 2.4.0)
> - Simplified JBoss and Wildfly deployment when using the agent: no need for workarounds using `jboss.modules.system.pkgs`, `java.util.logging.manager`, `-Xbootclasspath`
> - Added agent logging capture threshold, configurable via `<Logging threshold=""warn"" />` 
>   in the `AI-Agent.xml`, with default threshold `warn` ([#1026](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/1026))
> 
> ## Removed/Deprecated
> - Removed support for `<RuntimeException>` custom instrumentation in `AI-Agent.xml`
> 
> ## Bug Fixes
> - [#969](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/969) Fixes ability to configure Live Metrics iKey programatically.
> - [#978](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/978) Possible NPE during development
> - Fixed request telemetry displaying `200` response code for some failed requests ([#810](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/810))
> - Fixed GC performance counters not working ([#929](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/issues/929))
> 
> ## Miscellaneous
> - Starting with this release, you can now find the agent and the collectd plugin on Maven Central as `applicationinsights-agent` and `applicationinsights-collectd` under the same group, `com.microsoft.azure`.
> 
> ## Application Insights Java SDK 2.5.0-BETA.5
> Introducing Application Insights Java SDK 2.5.0-BETA.5!

Moreover, I removed the custom tab handling because it is now working as expected (i.e. #2902 is fixed in Java 9+).

Parsing the configuration file takes quite a bit of time and since we do not configure anything there, there is no need to have such a file. Hopefully, this does not destroy telemetry logging (have to check once people are using the new build).

I needed to revert 3fbe0a2b57340f03d7d1271eeeb30a061d724134 with fetch limiting as this is breaking the submodule  usage (see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/baa47ff95f13764f6ecb9f9ab38762f56752c342/checks?check_suite_id=252636752) - however, as far as I understood this limitation is nonetheless not necessary as the problem referred to by @Siedlerchr in #5364 was only the temporary problem in the java setup action.

A rough but working initial flatpak manifest. 

The idea of this pull request is that it can be reviewed early in the development process. Also I will need some help as a couple of things will needed to be decided on. I attached a list of Todos, but I haven't put too much thought in to it. Further I'm learning by doing here as I have only little experience with creating flatpaks. 

What are your comments? How should this be approached? My Questions are:

- What build pipeline should be used?
- What Identifier (app-id) should be used? 
  It must have the form of `org.developer.programm` but `org.jabref.jabref` seems a bit strange to me.
- Should there be daily/beta builds hooked into flathub (documentation is not too big on that feature https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2019/02/19/changes-in-flathub-land/)

Originally, my goal was to aggregate remote database queries for batch insertions and deletions, but in doing this, I discovered that it might simplify the code more in general if I combined `EntryEvent`s together for these in local databases as well. Currently, I am in the process of combining `EntryRemovedEvent`s into an `EntriesRemovedEvent`. Only one event would be fired if you removed multiple entries from the local database at a time. I haven't written unit tests for it yet or done any other testing, and my work so far was largely just to experiment with what parts of the code base I would have to change. There is still a lot of work to be done.

in /usr/lib/mozilla/native-messaging-hosts
To do that it needs a special permission that would need to be granted on the snapcraft forum.
This has been discussed with @tobiasdiez 
The user would need to type (I chose the name of the plugin, it can be changed):
`snap connect jabref:jabfox-integration`
If the folder in which it needs to copy the json file does not exist it will print an error message:
```
Missing directory, create it manually then try again:

(Partially) fixes issue https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5362

As requested by @tobiasdiez in the issue, I delegated the initialization of the auto completer to a background thread, to improve performance during start up.

I also moved the parsing process of the bib files into separate background tasks, which should speed up the start up of the GUI significantly (especially for a large amount of bib files to load).

Logging still does not work and there are a few error messages when starting JabRef. Reported these at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2690?focusedCommentId=16949986&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16949986.

This lead to problems like #5084 where users overwrite the contents of the entry while doing a search.

Gradle was warning about deprecated feature usage. Logs show jacoco append to be the feature that is deprecated.From my understandind the propery is currently ignored.

Removed the Jacoco append property from build.gradle and builds don't throw any deprecation warnings anymore.

The append property in Jacoco is meant to write to the same coverage file. But as mentioned in this [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/5269) setting it to true broke the build caching capability. So starting Gradle 5.0 a breaking change was introduced where they did away with the append property. The default behavior was set to behave as if append is initially false to enable build caching and then append is set to true before passing to the jacoco agent.
This meant that multiple tasks could not use the same coverage file but Jacoco merge is a feature that let's you achieve the same functionality. The gradle for the project does use Jacoco Merge to merge the various .exec file results, so removing the append property should not break coverage.

Using CompletableFuture instad of the usual Future object allows chaining of several asynchronous tasks very easily. This is a much more flexible way of dealing with asynchronous operations. I highly recomment using those methods I added instead of the old ones.

For those that are unfamiliar with the CompletableFuture pattern, they might want to have a look at my personal [project](https://github.com/Brainsucker92/picalculator/blob/master/src/main/java/calculator/impl/ChudnovskyCalculator.java) where I used this to split and chain some very expensive calculations which gave me a very simple but huge increase in throughput.

**REQUIRES TESTING!**

I removed unnecessary field dependencies from the `AbbreviateAction` class to make it much more flexible to use. There is no longer a `BasePanel` required to abbreviate BibEntries.
Also I split up the relatively big abbreviation task into a lot of smaller tasks, which increase concurrency a lot (divide and conquer FTW!)

Important events during the abbreviation process can now be listened to via the `AbbreviateActionListener` interface or `AbbreviateActionAdapter` class.

Unfortunately I cannot test any of the changes since I don't have any big database to run an abbreviation on.
Is there any testing data available?

I'd argue that quite often we don't want to see the full stack trace of Gradle. The motivating example for this was checking the outdated dependencies. We do have a error message for this, `There are outdated dependencies in build.gradle!\n Run ./gradlew dependencyUpdates to see which`, but the stacktrace still appeared and distracted from the normal error message.

I have been testing different alternatives and I think that this is the best choice (for using `XClipboard` a new dependency is needed, and it does not give any added value).

- All contents that JabRef sends to the system clipboard will be available in the X11 Primary clipboard too (i.e., `copyVersionToClipboard()` in the About dialog). So it is possible to paste it in a text editor, doing click in the middle/third mouse button.

![copy_version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12954316/67137766-aca48980-f23a-11e9-9bf0-a96ee1ef920f.gif)

- It is necessary to call the `install()` method in every text field where you want to use it. For the moment, it is activated in the `GlobalSearchBar`, therefore you can try it: write something, select a piece of text and do click in the middle button.

![global_search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12954316/67137765-ab735c80-f23a-11e9-8f17-2015c9833a20.gif)

- Now `ClipBoardManager` uses the singleton pattern. It is instantiated once in `Globals.java`.

Any feedback will be more than welcome! **:""D**

<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [classgraph's releases](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/releases).*

> ## classgraph-4.8.52
> Remove the shutdown hook entirely ([#376](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/classgraph/classgraph/issues/376)).
> 
> A shutdown hook has been in place for numerous releases, and its purpose was to call `ScanResult#close()` on any open `ScanResult` instances before JVM shutdown, in order to free up resources (delete any temporary files that had to be created to extract deflated nested jars; unmap mapped byte buffers; close open modules; close open files; free up allocated memory; etc.). However the JVM's own shutdown processes should take care of all of these steps, including the removal of any temporary files that are created, as they are marked for deletion on JVM shutdown. More importantly, `ScanResult` implements `Autocloseable`, and the ClassGraph documentation strongly recommends assigning `ScanResult` in a try-with-resources block so that each `ScanResult` is properly closed, so the shutdown hook was always just a fallback.
> 
> If you want to close all open (unclosed) `ScanResult` instances at once, you can call the new static method `ScanResult.closeAll()`. You might want to do this on container unload/destroy, in a containerized runtime.
> 
> ClassGraph automatically registers lifecycle listeners for [servlet](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/blob/master/src/main/java/nonapi/io/github/classgraph/classloaderhandler/lifecycle/ServletLifeCycleListener.java) containers and [Spring](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/blob/master/src/main/java/nonapi/io/github/classgraph/classloaderhandler/lifecycle/SpringLifeCycleListener.java) applications that call `ScanResult.closeAll()`, to ensure that resources are properly freed when containers are destroyed or unloaded.
> 
> Note that if you call `ScanResult.closeAll()`, you need to ensure that the lifecycle of the classloader matches the lifecycle of your application, or that two concurrent applications don't share the same classloader, otherwise one application might close another application's `ScanResult` instances while they are still in use.
> 
> ## classgraph-4.8.51
> In servlet containers and Spring applications, rather than adding a shutdown hook to close any unclosed `ScanResult` objects (to prevent resource leaks), instead add an event listener that closes unclosed `ScanResult` objects when the container is being torn down. This prevents a leak of the container's classloader ([#376](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/classgraph/classgraph/issues/376), thanks to [@&#8203;vimil](https://github.com/vimil) for reporting).
> 
> Please report any regressions with servlet containers or Spring.
> 
> ## classgraph-4.8.50
> No new functionality; only fixes static analysis warnings (switched on Eclipse JDT's nullability analysis warnings; fixed all warnings).
> 
> ## classgraph-4.8.49
> Fix `getClassInfo() cannot be called here` exception for `BaseTypeSignature` triggered by having an annotation with an array of primitive type references, e.g. `@MyAnnotation({ int.class })`. Thanks to [@&#8203;johndevs](https://github.com/johndevs) for reporting ([#375](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/classgraph/classgraph/issues/375)).

Some open Question for implementation:
* Which ids should be viable ids for IdBasedFetchers? Only DOI? Only ADS Bibcode? The current/old version can handle both, but I'm not sure if this is intentional. 
* We need an API key to access the API. I have one for development, but someone has to create one for the project.

Thats why I had to create an ExtraFilePseudoField-Class in one of my recent PRs. But this was an ugly hack.
JabRef should store instead in the columnPreferences not the fields, but the columns e.g. ""groups"" or ""special:rank"" or ""field:author"". The result would be, that the user is able to have a clickable uri-column ""linked_id"" in one column, and in another ""field:url"" the uri printed out.
Also they should finally be reorderable.

Thoughts?

I'm copying my comment from the issue page:


I found that in BracketedPattern.java on line 846 the comma is removed and therefore the AuthorList is not correct.
https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/bibtexkeypattern/BracketedPattern.java#L846

I would fix this issue by not applying BibtexKeyGenerator.removeUnwantedCharacters before extracting the author but afterwards. The tests pass, but can anyone think of a problem with that approach?

As it is my first PR to this project, any suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks for the great work!

This PR addresses the problems discussed in #5520 regarding the version update of JPackage.

We noted that the wix file created had a name change, so we took a copy of the wix file and stored it in the buildres folder for windows. As a result, the windows script needed to be changed to locate the wix file.

this PR adds an additional menu item to switch from biblatex to bibtex and vice versa. As discussed in the issue, I first wanted to add another combobox to the library properties pane but I noticed that in the save actions was a button which depended on the selected.
To keep things simple for 5.0 I rather adopted the way things used to work in Jabref 4.x by adding another menu item.

Any suggestions on this solution?

All the best

I also added the file to the deb postinst/postrm files so they are installed.
This is missing the windows/mac integration, but the only difference is the path (like the firefox file)
I added a different file even though the difference is minimal to avoid editing it in different scripts.
(postinst and install.sh mainly, the snap would still change the path)
Another PR in the JabRef repo will edit the manual install script to include the choice of browser.

This pull request updates citeproc-java to version 2.0.0. The new version uses GraalVM JavaScript on Java 11 and higher, so it should be significantly faster than the older one. Also, the internal citeproc-js process has been updated to the latest version.

I needed to add a `--add-exports` argument to make the module `com.oracle.truffle.regex` export the package `com.oracle.truffle.regex` to `org.graalvm.truffle`. Otherwise, the polyglot engine was not able to find the `regex` language. This might be a bug in GraalVM (i.e. a missing `exports` statement in the `org.graalvm.truffle` module). I opened an issue for that (https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1822).

I wasn't sure if I should amend the CHANGELOG or not. I can do this if you like me to.

All unit tests run successfully after this change.

*Sourced from [classgraph's releases](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/releases).*

> ## classgraph-4.8.53
> * Exposed raw type descriptor and/or type signature strings for methods, fields and classes ([#380](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/classgraph/classgraph/issues/380)):
>   * `MethodInfo#getTypeDescriptorStr()`

>   * `ClassInfo#getTypeSignatureStr()`
> * Removed `static final` check on fields before scanning for constant initializer values, to allow constant initializers to be read for non-static / non-final fields in Kotlin. (Java does not generate these, and technically Kotlin should not either, but one user relies on this in their Kotlin API -- [#379](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/classgraph/classgraph/issues/379).)

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [archunit-junit5-api's releases](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/releases).*

> ## ArchUnit 0.12.0
> # Breaking Changes
> 
> * So far ArchUnit's terminology has been a little sloppy with respect to the naming of inner and nested classes. By the [JLS](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se13/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.3) ""inner classes"" are those classes that are nested and not static. ArchUnit's API now reflects this via `JavaClass.isNestedClass()` versus `JavaClass.isInnerClass()`. Unfortunately this means that the method formerly called `JavaClass.isInnerClass()` will now return a different result, i.e. it will only return `true`, if the class is non-static. On the other hand, the method `JavaClass.isNestedClass()` will behave exactly like `isInnerClass()` did in ArchUnit 0.11.0 (see [#224](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/224); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;rweisleder](https://github.com/rweisleder) for the clarification and PR)
> * `JavaAccessCondition` does not filter self-accesses anymore. This was confusing behavior that did not solve the issue it was originally intended for. However, this might lead to additional violations showing up (see [#209](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/209))
> 
> # Bug Fixes
> 
> * Fixed bug where simple name of local classes was incorrect (see [#216](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/216); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;rweisleder](https://github.com/rweisleder))
> * `static` modifier was missing from nested classes (see [#219](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/219); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;rweisleder](https://github.com/rweisleder))
> 
> # Enhancements
> 
> ## Core
> 
> * Support for Java 14 (see [#230](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/230); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;hankem](https://github.com/hankem))
> * `JavaModifier` now contains `SYNTHETIC` and `BRIDGE` allowing more introspection and filtering of synthetic members (see [#243](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/243); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;alexfedorenchik](https://github.com/alexfedorenchik))
> * Every property in `archunit.properties` can now be overwritten by passing a system property. This can be valuable in CI environments, e.g. to specify the `ViolationStore` path for `FreezingArchRule`. Compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_overriding_configuration) (see [#252](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/252))
> * A `JavaClass` representing an array can now be queried for its component type (see [#187](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/187); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;alexfedorenchik](https://github.com/alexfedorenchik))
> * `JavaClass` now offers a classpath independent version of `getMethod(..)` and `getConstructor(..)` (see [#236](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/236); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;rweisleder](https://github.com/rweisleder))
> 
> ## Lang
> 
> * Extended syntax for `classes().thatAreEnums()` and `classes()...should().beEnums()` (see [#172](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/172); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;rweisleder](https://github.com/rweisleder))
> 
> ## Library
> 
> * `LayeredArchitecture` now also checks that no layer is empty. While originally with good intentions, the ability to define empty layers turned out to do more harm than good (see [#177](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/177); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;mikomatic](https://github.com/mikomatic))
> * `LayeredArchitecture` now allows layers to be defined by predicate. This allows for a way more flexible definition than simple package patterns (see [#228](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/228); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;mikomatic](https://github.com/mikomatic))
> * `FreezingArchRule` can now be configured to be more strict, when checking rules. In particular it is possible to forbid updates of the `ViolationStore` or the creation of a new `ViolationStore`. This can serve as a safeguard in CI environments, where a missing `ViolationStore` is typically a misconfiguration. Compare the [user guide](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html#_configuration) (see [#211](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/211); thanks a lot to [@&#8203;hankem](https://github.com/hankem) for reviewing and providing valuable improvements)

This JabRef extension is developed as part of a software engineering course. 
Even though we write this feature mainly for our university course, we are willing to adjust our feature, so that JabRef can benefit from it.

There is still some work to do, which includes:
- Work on the GROBID server
Sadly, we dont have enough time to work on that. (See also: https://github.com/NikodemKch/grobid/commit/e89810bd82b1b39cfcf82150d37b2200ac510a30)

Also, the provided GROBID server (http://grobid.cm.in.tum.de:8070/) takes too long to respond.
Feel free to take a look and give some feedback.

I found a bug where JavaFx was doing some recalculations during the initial layouting. 
Setting `setResizableWithParent` before initial layouting was finished resulted in JavaFx assuming a wrong fixed width.
I changed that by adding the code to a run later block.

It works good for me on Mac. Are there any concerns with that?

Best regards

Remove things that are no longer necessary/true. Moreover, stuff that can be easily found (like the license) is removed.

I was not sure which version the ""Installation"" guide should target. I guess the most logical would be 5.0 dev as github = development; stable releases + install instruction should be found on jabref.org

The way this is done is by first comparing the last saved file with the current (changed) file, and then trying to find additional/other changes in the currently open database. This is really complex and I believe there is some subtle bug in the logic leading to #5257.

With this PR, the change scanner is changed to a to simple 2-way merge between the current value in JabRef vs new value in file. This is way simpler and I hope this PR fixes #5257.
In a few edge cases, the 2-way merge has a small disadvantage. For example, consider the following steps:
- User A opens file
- User A changes field `Author` to `User A` and adds field `Title` with value `new`
- User B opens file
- User B changes field `Author` to `User B`
- User B saves file

At this point, User A gets a message that the file changed with the following changes:
- field `Author` changed from `User A` to `User B`
- field `Title` was removed

The 3-way merge could detect that `Title` was newly added, and thus could automatically reapply this change.  This is no longer possible with the simple 2-way merge.

5669koppor1366654open2019-11-24T11:11:21Z[WIP] Fix change on disk detection"This will solve the whole change-on-disk-dection things similar as conflicts are solved for a shared-database. This PR builds on https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5640 and is an alternative to https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5665.

## Implementation motivation

In 2016, I designed the database synchronization feature (https://docs.jabref.org/collaborative-work/sqldatabase), which I briefly described at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/2866#issuecomment-388264343:

- Multiple users should be supported ""seamlessly""
- If user A and B work on the bibfile, a modification by user A on a bibtex entry B1 should not trigger any ""changes"" dialog if user B did not do any changes.
- A ""Merge Entries"" dialog should popup if users A and B modified the same entry.

How this works can be tried out using the [Shared SQL Database Feature](http://help.jabref.org/en/SQLDatabase) of JabRef, where @obraliar and me worked hard to  have a very nice user experience.

Technically, this is not that easy to achieve. However, users will be happy, if it ""just works"".

At each instance of JabRef:

- Local state L is known
- Remote state R is known
- In case an update is made remotely, the diff can be applied to R.
  So R' is known. Based on R and R', the entries E where a change was made, are known.
  Based on E, changes can be applied to L.
  If in L the entry was not modified: just apply the update.
  If in L the entry was modified: Start the merge entries dialog.

## Implementation idea

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1366654/69493789-68e51580-0eb3-11ea-9da8-319a9ebfb246.png)

## Current implementation state

TODO:

- Add tests (multi-threading: update file in parallel, ... !)
- saved flag local in the update monitor
- Work on work on BibdatabaseDiff only
- Trigger the merge entries popup

Optional:
- Instead of the merge entries dialog, the changes should be displayed
- Add a button to the change display panel to open the merge entries dialog, because the merge entries dialog has a visual diff instead of a text-only description.

DONE:

- After a synchronization is triggered: the referenceFile is updated with the current database
- Synchronize change detection and file writing: should not happen in parallel
- Use !Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() instead of true in endless loop in thread

> ## classgraph-4.8.54
> Fix an issue where if a JPMS classloader (`AppClassLoader` or `PlatformClassLoader`) is passed into `overrideClassLoaders()`, module scanning needs to be manually enabled (since ClassGraph cannot get classpath URLs from those classloaders, so the separate JPMS module scanning code needs to be called instead of the normal classpath scanning code). ([#382](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/classgraph/classgraph/issues/382), thanks to [@&#8203;jamesward](https://github.com/jamesward) for reporting.)

Fixes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5399 and fixes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5657.
The following version information is automatically determined by GitVersion based on the current tags.

|  Context      | Build version |  Build information |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| PR            | 5.0.X         | 5.0-branch.Y       |
| Master        | 5.0.X         |  5.0               |
| After tag 5.1 | 5.1.X         |  5.1               |

Here, `X` is the number of commits since the last tag; and `Y is the number of commits on this branch; and `branch` is the branch name. Build version is the version used in gradle, i.e. the one used to generate the installer. Build information is what is displayed in the about dialog.
(Not sure if it really works on the master as it should; couldn't test it so far).

It should also work with tags of the form `5.0-beta` (which have `build version = 5.0.X` and `build information = 5.0-beta`). Thus, this PR hopefully also solves the problems of  https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5684.

> Release 2.0.0 - ???
>    BREAKING CHANGES in 2.0.0
> 
>    * Remove deprecated Metadata keys/properties (TIKA-1974).

> Release 1.23 - 12/02/2019
> 
>    * NOTE: The PDFParser now relies on OCRDPI to render page images when
>      users configure OCR on rendered page images. This will have the effect
>      of increasing rendered image size (TIKA-2624).
> 
>    * NOTE: tika-server no longer returns 415 for file types for which there
>      is no parser.
> 
>    * Fix bug in AUTO OCR strategy in the PDFParser (TIKA-3002).
>

>      from tika-config.xml via Eric Pugh (TIKA-2970).
> 
>    * Add parser for XLIFF v1.2 files (TIKA-2975).
> 
>    * Add mime type detection support for WebAssembly (TIKA-2894),
>      HEIF / HEIC images (TIKA-2942), Digilite FDF (TIKA-2988);
>      and xml-root detection for XFDF (TIKA-2990) and XDP (TIKA-2989).
> 
>    * Add an XLZ Parser (TIKA-2976).
>    
>    * Fix deadlock with ForkParser when InputStream throws IOException (TIKA-2892).
> 
> Release 1.22 - 07/29/2019
> 
>    * NOTE: tika-server no longer hard-codes the HtmlParser to handle
>      XML files (TIKA-2910).  Users must now configure that behavior
>      via a tika-config.xml file.
> 
>    * NOTE: Known regression: PDFBOX-4587 -- PDF passwords with codepoints
